The Email Domain Security Plan (EDSP) defines the security settings and other protections for email systems. It may be implemented as a stand-alone document, or as a section within an umbrella System Security document, provided it contains the unique values engineered for that domain. Without a System Security Plan, unqualified personnel may be assigned responsibilities that they are incapable of meeting and email security may become prone to an inconsistent or incomplete implementation. Because email systems are sufficiently unique, an EDSP is recommended. 

For some email data categories, the product specific STIG provides required security settings. For other categories, values can vary among domains, depending on the implementation and system sizing requirements. For example, tuning variables such as log sizes, mailbox quota limits, and partner domain security are engineered for optimal security and performance, and should therefore be documented so reviews can assess whether they are set as intended. Assigned administrator names by role enable assessment of roles separation and least privilege permissions, as well as the ability to identify unauthorized access of processes or data. Back-up and recovery artifacts, SPAM reputation providers, and anti-virus vendors may differ by domain, and will require operational support information to be recorded, for example, license agreements, product copy locations, and storage requirements. 

NIST publication SP800-18, which is publicly available, is entitled “Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems”. It gives both guidelines and a template for security plan creation, and can serve as a base for development if one is needed. At this writing, the document can be found at the following link: http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html. 

Security controls applicable to email systems may not be tracked and followed if they are not identified in the EDSP.

Since 2006, Microsoft best practices had taken the direction of creating operational “roles” for servers within email services. The Edge Transport server role (also called an Email Secure Gateway) was created to focus authentication and sanitization tasks in one server, to provide Internet facing protection for internal email servers. 

In the email services infrastructure, it has become imperative that inbound messages be examined prior to their being forwarded into the enclave, primarily due to the amount of SPAM and malware contained in the message stream. Similarly, outbound messages must be examined, so an organization might locate, or perhaps intercept, messages with potential data spillage of sensitive or important information. The Edge Transport email server role, which could be implemented using a number of comparable products, is designed to perform protective measures for both inbound and outbound messages. Its charter is to face the Internet, and to scrutinize all SMTP traffic, to determine whether to grant continued passage for messages to their destination. 

Inbound email sanitization steps include (but are not limited to) processes, such as sender authentication and evaluation, content scoring (SPAM, spoofing, and phishing detection), antivirus sanitization and quarantine services, and results reporting. Outbound messages are typically examined for SPAM and malware origination. 

Failure to implement an Email Edge Transport server role may increase risk of compromise by allowing undesirable inbound messages could to reach the internal servers and networks. Failure to examine outbound traffic may increase risk of domain blacklisting if SPAM or malware is traced back to the source domain. Attempting to sanitize email after it arrives inside the domain is not an acceptable or effective security measure. By using an Edge Transport Server (Email Secure Gateway), any SMTP-specific attack vectors are more optimally secured.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Other&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;EBBD-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target E-mail Services Policy</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>E-mail Services Policy</dc:subject><dc:identifier>1576</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-20241r3_fix">Install and configure an Edge Transport Server role in the email infrastructure, configured to perform specified sanitization processes.

The HTTP path to web sites is a proven convenience in requiring only a browser to access them, but is simultaneously a well known attack vector for people and applications that would attempt to gain unwelcome admittance to internal networks. 

Web-based email applications, such as Exchange Outlook Web App (OWA), are classified as 'internal' or 'private' web servers. As with all web servers in the DoD, Internet-sourced email requests must be encrypted, authenticated, and proxied prior to permitting the transaction to access internally hosted email data. For email domains using Microsoft Exchange Client Access (CA) servers, Microsoft recommends and supports that all email CA servers reside inside enclaves (rather than a DMZ location) where firewalls would separate them from the other email servers. DoD PKI approved mechanisms for authentication are required for email access in the DoD. Multiple products exist that could meet the intent of this requirement, such as combination firewall and proxy servers, multi-tasking load balancers or shared authentication services for Internet-sourced traffic.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Other&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;EBBD-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target E-mail Services Policy</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>E-mail Services Policy</dc:subject><dc:identifier>1576</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-20244r4_fix">Install a web security solution requiring DoD approved multi-factor authentication tokens, with architecture placing the CA server inside the enclave, and the transaction proxy residing in the DMZ.

The HTTP path to web sites is a proven convenience in requiring only a browser to access them, but is simultaneously a well known attack vector for people and applications that would attempt to gain unwelcome admittance to internal networks. 

Web-based email applications, such as Exchange Outlook Web App (OWA), are classified as 'internal' or 'private' web servers. As with all web servers in the DoD, Internet-sourced email requests must be encrypted, authenticated, and proxied prior to permitting the transaction to access internally hosted email data. DoD PKI approved mechanisms for authentication are required for email access in the DoD. Internet-sourced web traffic using TLS encryption is also required, however must have the encryption offloaded, and the transaction interrupted before allowing it into the enclave without some inspection.

The Department of Defense (DoD) Chief Information Officer (CIO) put forth specific guidance concerning CMD implementation on 6 Apr 2011. The memo states, "Email redirection from the email server (e.g., Exchange Server) to the device shall be controlled via centrally managed server." Therefore the native clients used on CMD cannot access the email system directly but instead must be managed by mobile email management (MEM) services. 

The Exchange configuration relies on Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) as the client communication protocol. Natively, EAS is an inbound initiated, bidirectional protocol, which is problematic for DoD networks. Acceptable implementations avoid inbound initiated connections and use external secure network operation centers (NOC) in secure tunnels from the management servers residing in the DoD to the NOC and from the NOC to the CMD.

For email systems that do not deliver email directly to the device but rather use browser access to DoD email systems, this requirement would not apply but client-access path guidance does (EMG3-108 Email).

The EDSP must include the functional architecture of the integration of the email system, required MEM, NOC if used, and CMDs. Protocols communicating with the CMD or NOC must be secured to protect sensitive DoD data from being compromised using accepted FIPS 140-2 approved modules.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Other&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;DCFA-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target E-mail Services Policy</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>E-mail Services Policy</dc:subject><dc:identifier>1576</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-44116r1_fix">Email client services to Commercial Mobile Devices, including the required components of the architecture, must be documented in the Email Domain Security Plan (EDSP).</fixtext><fix id="F-44116r1_fix" /><check system="C-46505r2_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_Exchange 2010 - Policy.xml" /><check-content>For systems not providing Internet-sourced email client services to CMDs, this check is N/A.

Access the Email Domain Security Plan (EDSP) for email systems. Review for functional architecture of the email system for all required components, including the MEM, NOC, CMDs, etc., when providing service to CMDs. Confirm the design requires secure communication from the email system to the MEM. Verify the MEM, NOC, and CMDs are approved for use in DoD. If the email domain employs the required architecture and is documented in the EDSP, this is not a finding.

If the architecture uses the EAS protocol to Commercial Mobile Devices (CMD) without connecting through external secure NOCs and encapsulating in a secure tunnel from the management servers residing in the DoD to the NOC and from the NOC to the CMD, this is a finding.  If the use of EAS is not documented in the EDSP, this is a finding.</check-content></check></Rule></Group></Benchmark>

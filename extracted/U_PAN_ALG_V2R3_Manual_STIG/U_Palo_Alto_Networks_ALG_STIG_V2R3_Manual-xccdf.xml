Remote access methods include both unencrypted and encrypted traffic (e.g., web portals, web content filter, TLS, and webmail). With inbound TLS inspection, the traffic must be inspected prior to being allowed on the enclave's web servers hosting TLS or HTTPS applications. With outbound traffic inspection, traffic must be inspected prior to being forwarded to destinations outside of the enclave, such as external email traffic. This requirement does not mandate the decryption and inspection of SSL/TLS; it requires that if this is performed in the device, the decrypted traffic be inspected and conform to security policies.

If SSL/TLS traffic is decrypted in the device, it must be inspected.  The Palo Alto Networks security platform can be configured to decrypt and inspect SSL/TLS connections going through the device.  With SSL Decryption, SSL-encrypted traffic is decrypted and App-ID and the Antivirus, Vulnerability, Anti-Spyware, URL Filtering, and File-Blocking Profiles can be applied to decrypted traffic before being re-encrypted and being forwarded.  This is not limited to SSL encrypted HTTP traffic (HTTPS); other protocols "wrapped" in SSL/TLS can be decrypted and inspected.

Decryption is policy-based and can be used to decrypt, inspect, and control both inbound and outbound SSL and SSH connections. Decryption policies allow the administrator to specify traffic for decryption according to destination, source, or URL category and in order to block or restrict the specified traffic according to security settings.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Palo Alto Networks ALG</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Palo Alto Networks ALG</dc:subject><dc:identifier>4233</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">SV-77037</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">V-62547</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-000067</ident><fixtext fixref="F-31044r513792_fix">Note: These instructions assume that certificates have already been loaded on the device.

Select "SSL Forward Proxy to decrypt and inspect SSL/TLS traffic from internal users to outside networks".
Select "SSH Proxy to decrypt inbound and outbound SSH connections passing through the device".
Select "SSL Inbound Inspection to decrypt and inspect incoming SSL traffic".

Note: This decryption mode can only work if you have control on the internal server certificate to import the Key Pair on Palo Alto Networks Device.

Decrypted traffic is blocked and restricted according to the policies configured on the firewall.  For each Decryption Policy, there must be a Security Policy in order to inspect and filter the decrypted traffic.  Multiple security policies can be configured; these instructions explain the steps involved but do not provide specific details since the exact local policies are not known.

A botnet is a collection of software agents (referred to as "bot"), residing on compromised computers.  Attacks are orchestrated by a "bot herder" to command these agents to launch attacks. Part of the command and control communication between the controller and the bots is a message sent from a bot that informs the controller that it is operating.  This is referred to as a "phone home" message.

On the Palo Alto Networks security platform, a security policy can include an Anti-spyware Profile for “phone home” detection (detection of traffic from installed spyware).  The device has two pre-configured Anti-spyware Profiles; Default and Strict.  The Default Anti-spyware Profile sends an alert for detected phone-home traffic for all severity levels except the low and informational severity threat levels, while the Strict Anti-spyware Profile blocks phone-home traffic for the critical, high, and medium severity threat levels.  

Phone home traffic must either be blocked or intercepted by the DNS Sinkholing feature. Therefore, a custom Anti-spyware Profile or the Strict Anti-spyware Profile must be used instead of the Default Anti-spyware Profile.  Note that there are specific implementation requirements for DNS Sinkholing to operate properly; refer to the Palo Alto Networks documentation for details.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Palo Alto Networks ALG</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Palo Alto Networks ALG</dc:subject><dc:identifier>4233</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">V-62569</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">SV-77059</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-001094</ident><fixtext fixref="F-31055r513825_fix">Go to Objects &gt;&gt; Security Profiles &gt;&gt; Anti-Spyware

This is a common practice in "botnets", which are a collection of compromised computers using malware to attack (usually DDoS) other computers or networks. DDoS attacks frequently leverage IP source address spoofing, in which packets with false source IP addresses send traffic to multiple hosts, who then send return traffic to the hosts with the IP addresses that were forged. This can generate significant, even massive, amounts of traffic. Therefore, protection measures to counteract IP source address spoofing must be taken.

Enclaves must enforce egress filtering. In egress filtering, packets leaving the enclave are discarded if the source IP address is not part of the IP address network(s), also known as prefixes, which are assigned to the enclave. A more specific form of egress filtering is to allow only those hosts and protocols that have been identified and authorized to exit the enclave. All traffic leaving the enclave, regardless of the destination, must be filtered by the premise router's egress filter to verify that the source IP address belongs to the enclave.

Configure a security policy that allows only traffic originating from the IP address prefixes assigned to the enclave to exit the enclave.  The implicit deny cross zone traffic rule will then be used, in part, to deny illegitimate source address traffic originating from an internal zone to go to another zone.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Palo Alto Networks ALG</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Palo Alto Networks ALG</dc:subject><dc:identifier>4233</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">SV-77061</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">V-62571</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-001094</ident><fixtext fixref="F-31056r513828_fix">Create an anti-spoofing policy for each outgoing zone that drops any traffic when the source IP does not match the list of allowed IP ranges for each outgoing zone.

Note that the 15 minute period is a maximum value; Administrators can choose shorter timeout values to account for system- or network-specific requirements.

On a Palo Alto Networks security platform,  a session is defined by two uni-directional flows, each uniquely identified by a 6-tuple key: source-address, destination-address, source-port, destination-port, protocol, and security-zone.  Besides the six attributes that identify a session, each session has few more notable identifiers: end hosts - the source IP and destination IP which will be marked as client(source IP) and server(destination IP) and flow direction - each session is bi-directional and is identified by a two uni-directional flows, the first flow is client-to-server(c2s) and the returning flow is server-to-client(s2c).

Sessions between endpoints are kept active by either normal traffic or by keepalive messages (also sometimes referred to as heartbeat messages).

If sending messages to an SNMP server or Syslog servers is used, follow the vendor guidance on how to configure that function.
To create an email server profile:
Go to Device &gt;&gt; Server Profiles &gt;&gt; Email
Select "Add". 
In the Email Server Profile, enter the name of the profile.
Select "Add".
In the "Servers" tab, enter the required information.
In the "Name" field, enter the name of the Email server.
In the "Email Display Name" field, enter the name shown in the "From" field of the email.
In the "From" field, enter the "From email address".
In the "To" field, enter the email address of the recipient.
In the "Additional Recipient" field, enter the email address of another recipient. You can only add one additional recipient. To add multiple recipients, add the email address of a distribution list.
In the "Gateway" field, enter the IP address or host name of the Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) server used to send the email.
Select the "OK" button.
After you create the Server Profiles that define where to send your logs, you must enable log forwarding. 
Threat Logs-Enable forwarding of Threat logs by creating a Log Forwarding Profile (Objects &gt;&gt; Log Forwarding) that specifies which severity levels you want to forward and then adding it to the security policies for which you want to trigger the log forwarding. A Threat log entry will only be created (and therefore forwarded) if the associated traffic matches a Security Profile (Antivirus, Anti-spyware, Vulnerability, URL Filtering, File Blocking, Data Filtering, or DoS Protection).
Configure the log-forwarding profile to select the logs to be forwarded to Email server.
Go to Objects &gt;&gt; Log forwarding
The "Log Forwarding Profile" window appears.  Note: It has five columns.  
In the "Name" Field, enter the name of the Log Forwarding Profile.
In the "Threat Settings" Section in the "Email" column, select the Email server profile for forwarding threat logs to the configured server(s).
Select the "OK" button.
When the "Log Forwarding Profile" window disappears, the screen will show the configured log-forwarding profile.
For Threat Logs, use the log forwarding profile in the security rules.
Go to Policies &gt;&gt; Security Rule.
Select the rule for which the log forwarding needs to be applied, which in this case is the Security Policy that is used to detect malicious code (the "Profile" column does display the Antivirus Profile symbol). Apply the log forwarding profile to the rule.
In the "Actions" tab in the "Log Setting" section; in the "Log Forwarding" field, select the log forwarding profile from drop-down list.
Note: The Log Forwarding field can only have one profile.

Installation of content filtering gateways and application-layer firewalls at key boundaries in the architecture mitigates the risk of DoS attacks. These attacks can be detected by matching observed communications traffic with patterns of known attacks and monitoring for anomalies in traffic volume/type.

Detection components that use rate-based behavior analysis can detect attacks when signatures for the attack do not exist or are not installed. These attacks include zero-day attacks that are new attacks for which vendors have not yet developed signatures. Rate-based behavior analysis can detect sophisticated, Distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks by correlating traffic information from multiple network segments or components.

PAN-OS can use either Zone-Based Protection or End Host Protection to mitigate DoS attacks.  Zone-Based Protection protects against most common floods, reconnaissance attacks and other packet-based attacks and is applied to any zone.  End Host Protection is specific to defined end hosts.

Access control policies and access control lists implemented on devices that control the flow of network traffic (e.g., application-level firewalls and Web content filters), ensure the flow of traffic is only allowed from authorized sources to authorized destinations. Networks with different levels of trust (e.g., the Internet or CDS) must be kept separate.

Security policies on the Palo Alto Networks security platform match source, destination, application and a service. The application and service columns specify what applications can be identified on a defined set of ports, or on all available ports. The service column allows administrator to define one of the following:
Application-default - The service application-default sets security policy to allow the application on the standard ports associated with the application.
Pre-defined service “service-http” and “service-https” - The pre-defined services use TCP ports 80 and 8080 for HTTP, and TCP port 443 for HTTPS. Use this security policy if you want to restrict web browsing and HTTPS to these ports.

This allows Administrators to configure and enforce firewall policies based on users and user groups in addition to network zones and addresses. If the user changes devices or the device is assigned a different IP address, User-ID tracks those changes and maintains the user to IP address mapping information.  This supports non-repudiation.

Depending on the type of ALG, organizations can monitor information systems by monitoring audit activities, application access patterns, characteristics of access, content filtering, or unauthorized exporting of information across boundaries. Unusual/unauthorized activities or conditions may include large file transfers, long-time persistent connections, unusual protocols and ports in use, and attempted communications with suspected malicious external addresses.

Most current applications are deployed as a multi-tier architecture. The multi-tier model uses separate server machines to provide the different functions of presentation, business logic, and database.  The multi-tier architecture provides added security because a compromised web server does not provide direct access to the application itself or to the database.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Palo Alto Networks ALG</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Palo Alto Networks ALG</dc:subject><dc:identifier>4233</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">SV-77109</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">V-62619</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-002662</ident><fixtext fixref="F-31081r513903_fix">The network architecture diagrams must identify where traffic crosses from one internal zone to another.

Since blocking these UDP ports alone will not block trace route capabilities along with blocking potentially legitimate traffic on a network, it's unnecessary to block them explicitly.  Because traceroutes typically rely on ICMP Type 11 - Time exceeded message, the time exceeded message will be the target for implicitly or explicitly blocking outbound from the trusted network.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Palo Alto Networks ALG</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Palo Alto Networks ALG</dc:subject><dc:identifier>4233</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">V-62631</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">SV-77121</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-001314</ident><fixtext fixref="F-31087r513921_fix">Although the default inter-zone Security Policy will deny this traffic, a specific Security Policy should be used.

The way forwarding is enabled depends on the log type:
Traffic Logs-Enable forwarding of Traffic logs by creating a Log Forwarding Profile (Objects &gt;&gt; Log Forwarding) and adding it to the security policies to trigger the log forwarding. Only traffic that matches a specific rule within the security policy will be logged and forwarded.

Configure the log-forwarding profile to select the logs to be forwarded to syslog server.

When the "Log Forwarding Profile" window disappears, the screen will show the configured log-forwarding profile.
Threat Logs-Enable forwarding of Threat logs by creating a Log Forwarding Profile (Objects &gt;&gt; Log Forwarding) that specifies which severity levels to forward and then adding it to the security policies for which to trigger the log forwarding. A Threat log entry will only be created (and therefore forwarded) if the associated traffic matches a Security Profile (Antivirus, Anti-spyware, Vulnerability, URL Filtering, File Blocking, Data Filtering, or DoS Protection).

Configure the log-forwarding profile to select the logs to be forwarded to syslog server.
Go to Objects &gt;&gt; Log forwarding
The "Log Forwarding Profile" window appears.  Note that it has five columns.
In the "Syslog" column, select the syslog server profile for forwarding threat logs to the configured server(s).
Select the "OK" button.

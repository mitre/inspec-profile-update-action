In many cases, DNS logs are included within the system logs. If this is the case, then daily review of the system logs meets the requirement.
 
If the site employs special software to scan logs for special events or key words, then this is also acceptable so long as the system issues real time alerts or is monitored at least daily.

The roles of the SA and the DNS administrator or DNS manager are generally understood but are often used interchangeably. The SA is responsible for the OS, while the DNS administrator or DNS manager usually manages the DNS zones. In some cases, the SA is also the DNS administrator/DNS manager, which is why guidance tends to be written in a certain fashion. The application development group should refer to the supporting organization for the application when application issues arise from meeting DNS server requirements.

There should always be a hot backup of zone information present whenever the primary name server is unavailable for any reason (i.e., the authoritative slave server maintains a copy of the zone files on the master).  This built-in redundancy, however, does not extend to configuration files and logs.  Therefore, name servers should be backed up to an external media (e.g., tape, optical disk, etc.) on a regular basis.

At some locations, an automated enterprise backup system supports many servers.  In this case, name servers can simply be added to the enterprise system.  At other locations, backups must be performed manually, placing a considerably higher burden on administrators.  In circumstances in which zone and configuration information is very static, remaining the same for several months at a time, it would make little sense to conduct daily full backups.  Backups should occur as frequently as needed to capture changes on the name server.

If there are no written procedures for the backup of name servers, then this is a finding.  Backup in this context refers to copying the name server’s DNS configuration, keys, zones,  and resource record data, at a minimum, in case it is needed for recovery at a later time.  A full file system backup of the name server is preferred.

If there are written backup procedures, then it must call for the backup of DNS configuration, keys, zones, and resource record data on any day in which they were modified, it this is not the case, then this is a finding.  

Any traditional daily tape backup scheme – whether it involves a full, incremental or differential scheme – will satisfy the requirement.  Less frequent backups will also suffice if the configuration and resource record data are backed up whenever they are modified.

If there is a known compromise of a TSIG key, then it needs to be replaced immediately.

The zone file location can be found by examining the named.conf and searching for the zone statement.  Within the zone statement will be a file option that will display the name of the zone file.

Windows 
Ask the DNS database administrator if they maintain a separate database with record documentation.  Windows DNS does not provide the capability to insert comments for records in a zone.  

Review the zone files/database. If the records are not fully documented, then this is a finding.  The zone record documentation is to include, at a minimum:

-	The owner of each zone record
-	The date the zone record was created
-	The date the zone record was last modified
-	The date the zone record was last verified

Records can be grouped (e.g., a number of workstations residing in the same area or a high-availability server cluster)

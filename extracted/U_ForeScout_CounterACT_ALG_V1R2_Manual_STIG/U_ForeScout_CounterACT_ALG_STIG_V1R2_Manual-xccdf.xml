System use notifications are required only for access via logon interfaces with human users and are not required when such human interfaces do not exist, for example, with CounterACT guest access function. This requirement applies to network elements that have the concept of a user account and have the logon function residing on the network element. This requirement is not for access to the device itself, such as with system administrators of CounterACT, but rather is related to the network access control function provided to the users.

The banner must be formatted in accordance with DTM-08-060. Use the following verbiage for network elements that can accommodate banners of 1300 characters:

"You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized use only.

Audit processing failures include: software/hardware errors, failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded. Responses to audit failure depend upon the nature of the failure mode.

When availability is an overriding concern, other approved actions in response to an audit failure are as follows: 

1. If the failure was caused by the lack of audit record storage capacity, the network element must continue generating audit records if possible (automatically restarting the audit service if necessary), overwriting the oldest audit records in a first-in-first-out manner.

2. If audit records are sent to a centralized collection server and communication with this server is lost or the server fails, the network element must queue audit records locally until communication is restored or until the audit records are retrieved manually. Upon restoration of the connection to the centralized collection server, action should be taken to synchronize the local audit data with the collection server.

A NAC is an essential security service and should not be shut down in the event of an audit failure.

Signed SMB and encrypted MAPI traffic use techniques to protect against unauthorized man-in-the-middle devices from making modifications to their exchanged data. Additionally, encrypted MAPI traffic and encrypted SMB3 traffic ensure data confidentiality by transmitting data with protection across the network. 

To securely optimize this traffic, a properly configured client and server-side SteelHead appliance with the SteelHead WAN optimization platform must:

- decrypt and remove signatures on received LAN side data from the client or server.
- perform bandwidth and application layer optimization.
- use the secure inner channel feature to maintain data integrity and confidentiality of data transmitted over the WAN.
- convert the received optimized data back to its native form.
- encrypt and apply signatures for LAN side transmission of data to the client or server.

To query the Windows domain controller for the necessary cryptographic information to optimize this traffic, the server-side SteelHead appliance must join a Windows domain. The SteelHead appliance can require other configurations, both on the SteelHead appliance, and in the Windows domain. This cryptographic information is only useful for the lifetime of an individual connection or session. The information is obtained at the beginning of a connection, and transferred to the client-side SteelHead appliance as needed, using the secure inner channel feature. You must configure the secure inner channel to ensure maximum security.

Only the server-side SteelHead appliance is required to join the domain, and it does so using a machine account in the same way that a Windows device joins the domain using a machine account. The SteelHead appliance joins the domain this way to obtain a client user session key (CUSK) or server user session key (SUSK), which allows the SteelHead appliance to sign and/or decrypt MAPI on behalf of the Windows user that is establishing the relevant session.

The server-side SteelHead appliance must join a domain that is either: 
- the user domain. The domain must have a trust with the domains that include the application servers (file server, Exchange server, and so on) you want to optimize.
- A domain with a bi-directional trust with the user domain. The domain might include some or all of the Windows application servers (file server, Exchange server) for SteelHead appliance optimization. Production deployments can have multiple combinations of client and server Windows operating system versions, and can include different configuration settings for signed SMB and encrypted MAPI. NTLM is not approved for use for DoD implementations. Therefore it is possible that the security authentication between clients and servers can use Kerberos, or a combination of the two.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Riverbed SteelHead CX Version 8 ALG</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Riverbed SteelHead CX Version 8 ALG</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2929</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-000060</ident><fixtext fixref="F-68707r2_fix">On the Server-Side SteelHead appliance Navigate to the device Management Console.

The Riverbed Optimization System TLS optimization solution accelerates data transfers that are encrypted using TLS, provided SteelHead appliances that are deployed locally to both the client-side and server-side of the network. All of the same optimized connections that are applied to normal non-encrypted TCP traffic can also apply to encrypted TLS traffic. SteelHead appliances with RiOS accomplish this without compromising end-to-end security and the established trust model. Private keys remain in the data center and are not exposed in remote locations where they might be compromised.

The RiOS TLS optimization solution starts with SteelHead appliances that have a configured trust relationship, enabling them to exchange information securely over their own dedicated TLS connection. Each client uses unchanged server addresses and each server uses unchanged client addresses; no application changes or explicit proxy configuration is required. RiOS uses a unique technique to split the TLS handshake. The handshake is the sequence of message exchanges at the start of a TLS connection. In an ordinary TLS handshake, the client and server first establish identity using public-key cryptography, and then negotiate a symmetric session key to use for data transfer. When using RiOS TLS acceleration, the initial TLS message exchanges take place between the client application (for example, a Web browser) and the server side SteelHead appliance.

SteelHead WAN optimization platform works to ensure that TLS acceleration delivers the following:

- sensitive cryptographic information is kept in the secure vault - a separate, encrypted store on the disk.
- built-in support for popular Certificate Authorities (CAs) such as VeriSign, Thawte, Entrust, and GlobalSign. In addition, SteelHead appliances allow the installation of other commercial or privately operated CAs.
- import of server proxy certificates and keys in PEM, PKCS12, or DER formats. SteelHead appliances also support the generation of new keys and self-signed certificates. If your certificates and keys are in another format, you must first convert them to a supported format before you can import them into the SteelHead appliance.
- separate control of cipher suites for client connections, server connections, and peer connections.
- bulk export or bulk import server configurations (including keys and certificates) from or to, respectively, the server-side SteelHead appliance.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Riverbed SteelHead CX Version 8 ALG</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Riverbed SteelHead CX Version 8 ALG</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2929</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-000068</ident><fixtext fixref="F-68733r1_fix">Configure RiOS providing TLS optimization services to provide end-to-end security and protection for private keys.

Related services include content filtering, traffic analysis, decryption, caching, and traffic inspection tools (e.g., firewall, IDS), unrelated services include email, DNS, web server.

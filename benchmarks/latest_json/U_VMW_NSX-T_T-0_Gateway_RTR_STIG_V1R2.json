A fundamental step in securing each router is to enable only the capabilities required for operation.","check":"From the NSX-T Manager web interface, go to Networking >> Tier-0 Gateways.\n\nFor every Tier-0 Gateway, expand the Tier-0 Gateway, then expand Multicast to view the Multicast configuration.\n\nIf Multicast is enabled and not in use, this is a finding.","fix":"To disable Multicast do the following:\n\nFrom the NSX-T Manager web interface, go to Networking >> Tier-0 Gateways and edit the target Tier-0 Gateway.\n\nExpand Multicast, change from \"Enabled\" to \"Disabled\", and then click \"Save\"."},"impact":0.3,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target VMware NSX-T Tier-0 Gateway RTR"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-55196r810159_chk","severity":"low","gid":"V-251759","rid":"SV-251759r810161_rule","stig_id":"T0RT-3X-000096","gtitle":"SRG-NET-000131-RTR-000035","fix_id":"F-55150r810160_fix","documentable":null,"cci":["CCI-000381"],"nist":["CM-7 a"]}}],"groups":[{"id":"controls/SV-251744.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-251744"]},{"id":"controls/SV-251745.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-251745"]},{"id":"controls/SV-251746.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-251746"]},{"id":"controls/SV-251747.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-251747"]},{"id":"controls/SV-251748.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-251748"]},{"id":"controls/SV-251749.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-251749"]},{"id":"controls/SV-251750.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-251750"]},{"id":"controls/SV-251751.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-251751"]},{"id":"controls/SV-251752.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-251752"]},{"id":"controls/SV-251753.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-251753"]},{"id":"controls/SV-251754.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-251754"]},{"id":"controls/SV-251755.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-251755"]},{"id":"controls/SV-251756.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-251756"]},{"id":"controls/SV-251757.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-251757"]},{"id":"controls/SV-251758.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-251758"]},{"id":"controls/SV-251759.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-251759"]}],"name":"VMW_NSX-T_T-0_RTR_STIG","title":null,"maintainer":null,"copyright":null,"copyright_email":null,"license":null,"summary":null,"description":null,"version":"1.0.0","supports":[],"depends":[],"inspec_version":null,"inputs":[],"sha256":"cf92bd5798c7337872b56f2d8dec0bda7c86d9efb7409f675b6035fcbd0fa9c0","status_message":"","status":"loaded","generator":{"name":"inspec","version":"6.6.0"}}

It is normally used for traffic engineering, but can also be used to meet security requirements; for example, traffic that is not allowed can be routed to the Null0 or discard interface. Policy Routing can also be used to control which prefixes appear in the routing table.\n\nTraffic can be restricted directly by an ACL (which is a firewall function), or by Policy Routing. This requirement is intended to allow network administrators the flexibility to use whatever technique is most effective.","check":"Review the Cisco IOS XE router configuration to determine if the router only allows incoming communications from authorized sources to be routed to authorized destinations.\n\nThe configuration should look similar to the following example:\n\ninterface GigabitEthernet 0/0/1\ndescription NIPRNet link\nip address x.x.x.x 255.255.255.0\nip access-group Authorized_Sources_ACL in\n...\n\nip access-list extended Authorized_Sources_ACL\ndeny ip 1.1.1.0 0.0.0.255 any log\n...\n\nIf the Cisco IOS XE router does not restrict incoming communications to allow only authorized sources and destinations, this is a finding.","fix":"Configure the Cisco IOS XE router to only allow incoming communications from authorized sources to be routed to authorized destinations.\n\nThe configuration would look similar to the example below:\n\ninterface GigabitEthernet 0/0/1\ndescription  NIPRNet link\nip address x.x.x.x 255.255.255.0\nip access-group Authorized_Sources_ACL in\n...\n\nip access-list extended Authorized_Sources_ACL\ndeny ip 1.1.1.0 0.0.0.255 any log\n..."},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target Cisco IOS XE RTR"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-74227r2_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-74141","rid":"SV-88815r2_rule","stig_id":"CISR-RT-000025","gtitle":"SRG-NET-000364-RTR-000109","fix_id":"F-80683r2_fix","documentable":null,"cci":["CCI-002403"],"nist":["SC-7 (11)"]}}],"groups":[{"id":"controls/SV-88769.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-88769"]},{"id":"controls/SV-88771.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-88771"]},{"id":"controls/SV-88773.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-88773"]},{"id":"controls/SV-88777.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-88777"]},{"id":"controls/SV-88779.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-88779"]},{"id":"controls/SV-88781.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-88781"]},{"id":"controls/SV-88783.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-88783"]},{"id":"controls/SV-88785.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-88785"]},{"id":"controls/SV-88787.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-88787"]},{"id":"controls/SV-88789.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-88789"]},{"id":"controls/SV-88791.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-88791"]},{"id":"controls/SV-88793.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-88793"]},{"id":"controls/SV-88795.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-88795"]},{"id":"controls/SV-88797.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-88797"]},{"id":"controls/SV-88799.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-88799"]},{"id":"controls/SV-88801.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-88801"]},{"id":"controls/SV-88803.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-88803"]},{"id":"controls/SV-88805.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-88805"]},{"id":"controls/SV-88807.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-88807"]},{"id":"controls/SV-88809.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-88809"]},{"id":"controls/SV-88811.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-88811"]},{"id":"controls/SV-88813.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-88813"]},{"id":"controls/SV-88815.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-88815"]}],"name":"Cisco_IOS_XE_Release_3_RTR_STIG","title":null,"maintainer":null,"copyright":null,"copyright_email":null,"license":null,"summary":null,"description":null,"version":"1.0.0","supports":[],"depends":[],"inspec_version":null,"inputs":[],"sha256":"939a7ebf96ab8d755cdf507c2869cfb57f5d2a05452a3f0b3d2317f09197200b","status_message":"","status":"loaded","generator":{"name":"inspec","version":"6.6.0"}}

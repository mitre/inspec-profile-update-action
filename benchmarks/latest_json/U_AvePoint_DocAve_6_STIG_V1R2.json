If the CA used for verifying the certificate is not a DoD-approved CA, trust of this CA has not been established.\n\nThe DoD will only accept PKI certificates obtained from a DoD-approved internal or external certificate authority. Reliance on CAs for the establishment of secure sessions includes, for example, the use of TLS certificates. \n\nThis requirement focuses on communications protection for the application session rather than for the network packet.\n\nThis requirement applies to applications that utilize communications sessions. This includes, but is not limited to, web-based applications and Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA).","check":"There are three different settings in DocAve that are related to certificates:\n- The DocAve web server for the web UI;\n- The DocAve Manager communication certificate for communicate with DocAve Agents;\n- The DocAve Agent communication certificate for communicate with DocAve Manager.\n\nCheck the DocAve Web Site certificate setting.\n- On the DocAve 6 Manager server, open Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager.\n- In IIS Manager, expand the Sites node in the Connections panel on the left and find DocAve 6 Control Service Web Site.

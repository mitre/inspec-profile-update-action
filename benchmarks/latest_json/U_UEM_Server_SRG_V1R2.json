If passwords are not encrypted, they can be plainly read and easily compromised. Use of passwords for authentication is intended only for limited situations and should not be used as a replacement for two-factor CAC-enabled authentication. \n\nExamples of situations where a user ID and password might be used include:\n\n- When the user does not use a CAC and is not a current DoD employee, member of the military, or DoD contractor.\n\n- When a user has been officially designated as temporarily unable to present a CAC for some reason (lost, damaged, not yet issued, broken card reader) (i.e., Temporary Exception User) and to satisfy urgent organizational needs must be temporarily permitted to use user ID/password authentication until the problem with CAC use has been remedied.\n\n- When the application is publicly available and or hosting publicly releasable data requiring some degree of need-to-know protection.\n\nIf the password is already encrypted and not a plaintext password, this meets this requirement. Implementation of this requirement requires configuration of FIPS-approved cipher block algorithm and block cipher modes for encryption. This method uses a one-way hashing encryption algorithm with a salt value to validate a user's password without having to store the actual password.

Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user access) without terminating network sessions.\n\nSession termination terminates all processes associated with a user's logical session except those processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated. \n\nConditions or trigger events requiring automatic session termination can include, for example, organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, and time-of-day restrictions on information system use.\n\nThis capability is typically reserved for specific application system functionality where the system owner, data owner, or organization requires additional assurance. Based upon requirements and events specified by the data or application owner, the application developer must incorporate logic into the application that will provide a control mechanism that disconnects users upon the defined event trigger. The methods for incorporating this requirement will be determined and specified on a case-by-case basis during the application design and development stages. \n\nSatisfies:FMT_SMF.1.1(2) b \nReference:PP-MDM-431014","check":"Verify the UEM server automatically terminates a user session after an organization-defined period of user inactivity.\n\nIf the UEM server does not automatically terminate a user session after an organization-defined period of user inactivity, this is a finding.","fix":"Configure the UEM server to automatically terminate a user session after an organization-defined period of user inactivity."},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target Unified Endpoint Management Server"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-37627r614336_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-234442","rid":"SV-234442r879673_rule","stig_id":"SRG-APP-000295-UEM-000169","gtitle":"SRG-APP-000295","fix_id":"F-37592r614337_fix","documentable":null,"cci":["CCI-002361"],"nist":["AC-12"]}},{"id":"SV-234443","code":"control 'SV-234443' do\n  title 'The UEM server must provide logout capability for user-initiated communication sessions.'\n  desc 'If a user cannot explicitly end an application session, the session may remain open and be exploited by an attacker; this is referred to as a zombie session.\n\nInformation resources to which users gain access via authentication include, for example, local workstations, databases, and password-protected websites/web-based services.

If pre-shared keys are appropriate and supported, the following additional guidelines must be followed. Consult 800-52 for recommended pre-shared key cipher suites for pre-shared keys. Pre-shared keys must be distributed in a secure manner, such as a secure manual distribution or using a key establishment certificate.

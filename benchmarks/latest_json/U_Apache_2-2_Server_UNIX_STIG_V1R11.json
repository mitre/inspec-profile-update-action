The web server will reply with the cipher suite it will use for communication from the client list.  If an attacker can intercept the submission of cipher suites to the web server and place, as the preferred cipher suite, a weak export suite, the encryption used for the session becomes easy for the attacker to break, often within minutes to hours.","check":"Locate the Apache httpd.conf and ssl.conf file if available.\nOpen the httpd.conf and ssl.conf file with an editor and search for the following uncommented directive: SSLCipherSuite\nFor all enabled SSLCipherSuite directives, ensure the cipher specification string contains the kill cipher from list option for all export cipher suites, i.e., !EXPORT, which may be abbreviated !EXP.

A PC could be dedicated to a task, protected, and controlled such that it is highly available for mission critical applications and communications. However, a user’s general purpose PC or other computing device may not be highly available for mission critical communications, particularly if it is not dedicated to that task. This because it supports many applications and functions while being connected to a network through which any number of threats can come. Mission critical applications and communications are also negatively affected if the PC is powered off, busy with another process, the communications application is not loaded or running properly, or if the PC is compromised and/or is having operational problems. While a fixed desktop or tower PC may be kept in a powered on and network connected state most of the time, a portable PC (laptop) is much more likely to be powered off and disconnected from the network. There is more chance that the PC and communications application won’t work, or be available, when needed compared to a dedicated device such as purpose built hard phones or dedicated PCs. Power for operating the PCs is another consideration in our discussion of their support for assured services and mission critical systems, users, and locations. If there is no power in the user’s workspace, the PC will not function unless a backup power supply is provided. Thus may be provided using a battery based Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) or a backup generator. Either solution is very costly when providing backup power to the workspace for the PC, particularly for large numbers of users. Provisions for light and other environmental factors may also be necessary adding to cost. On the other hand, power is much more easily provided to a hardware based phone from the wiring closet using the LAN cabling. A UPS or generator will still be needed but in a centralized location reducing cost. Another factor is the robustness and reliability of the network to which the PC is connected. As noted above, DoD networks can and must be designed and controlled to provide the reliability and robustness needed to support assured service. This can work well for a dedicated communications endpoint but not necessarily for a PC communications application. This is because the PC will be connected to the portion of the LAN that carries normal data traffic by default. That is the portion of the LAN that can be compromised and degraded by various DoS attacks and other issues making it difficult for this portion of the LAN to provide assured service. The VoIP STIG defines some of the LAN requirements for the support of assured service, most notably the separation of the voice assets and traffic on the LAN from the data assets and traffic while maintaining a converged LAN architecture. Various solutions may also be available that can allow a PC to mitigate or manage these issues. These will be discussed later in the LAN use case section of this STIG. \n\nA remotely connected PC cannot be relied upon to support assured service if it is connected to a non-DoD network such as an Internet connected LAN or the internet itself. This is due to lack of DoD control over the network to which it is attached. While most non-DoD LANs and the Internet are relatively reliable and may be robust regarding bandwidth, there is no control over the conditions in, or the availability of, these networks, whether it is the LAN or WAN. Based on the factors noted in the previous paragraphs, PCs cannot provide the reliability and availability required for assured service when compared to the reliability and availability specifications for a LAN supporting assured service. These factors make it difficult to consider a user’s general purpose fixed, or portable, PC as being a stable platform for mission critical communications in an assured service sense, even though that is desired. All of these factors also affect non-assured service systems that provide life safety and emergency communications. In the future, PC and PC based communications application vendors may solve these problems and provide us with fully assured service capable PC based communications on a standard general purpose, general use platform at a reasonable cost. These issues do not, however, preclude a PC based communications application from attempting to place and receive priority communications sessions.

A C2 user may use this type of end instrument for the origination of, or reception of routine and non-routine calls at their discretion, as long as a purpose built instrument or other backup communications system/device is also available for use as a backup communications method when necessary. This however, may not be feasible in all situations such as when using a portable PC outside of the normal workspace.\nNote: Voice communications is the most critical communications service for C2 users. While VTC and collaboration is an important C2 tool, a telephone call is the minimal method needed to give and receive orders. Since a PC based application may not be available at all times, backup voice communications methods are needed. This could be accomplished in several ways. Minimally, in the normal workspace, there needs to be a hardware based telephone, either IP or otherwise, connected to a different portion of the network than the PC. While a hardware based IP phone could be associated with the PC, if the portion of the network serving the PC was the cause of the PC being inoperable for C2 communications, the phone might also not be available or operational.","check":"Interview the IAO and a sampling of C2 or Special-C2 users to determine if C2 or Special-C2 users are provided with a more reliable communications method than a PC based communications application in compliance with the following requirement: \n\nWithin a C2 or Special-C2 user’s normal workspace (e.g., office) or alternate fixed workspace (e.g., quarters, alternate office), ensure C2 and Special-C2 users are provided with an alternate assured service communications device/system (e.g., hardware based IP or traditional telephone endpoint) is provided as backup to a PC based communications application (e.g., soft-phone) for their mission critical assured service (C2) voice communications needs if and when the PC or application fails or is unavailable. \n\nNote: Cell phones. PDA/PEDs, or other wireless devices are not considered reliable enough within a normal workspace to meet this requirement due to lack of reliable signal everywhere and their inability to be used in certain DoD environments. However these could be considered in a remote use case.\n\nNOTE: This is not intended to require the installation of assured service communications devices in alternate workspaces such as quarters unless there is a requirement for the C2 or Special-C2 user to place and receive C2 communications in that location.\n\nThis is a finding if C2 or Special-C2 users are not provided with a more reliable communications method than a PC based communications application for their assured service needs.","fix":"Ensure C2 and Special-C2 users are provided with an alternate assured service communications device/system (e.g., hardware based IP or traditional telephone endpoint) is provided as backup to a PC based communications application (e.g., soft-phone) for their mission critical assured service (C2) voice communications needs \n\nMinimally provide C2 and Special-C2 users with a hardware based telephone and supporting infrastructure that can support reliable assured service communications within their normal or alternate workspaces."},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-17115r1_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-16073","rid":"SV-17060r1_rule","stig_id":"VVoIP 1205 (GENERAL)","gtitle":"Deficient COOP: C2 User’s Backup for PC Comm app","fix_id":"F-16177r1_fix","documentable":null,"severity_override_guidance":"This is “not a finding” in the event the PC, PC communications application, and the network to which it is attached can be proven to provide the reliability and availability needed to support assured service communications.

If this was to occur, there could be inadvertent disclosure of sensitive or classified information to individuals without the proper clearance or need-to-know. This vulnerability could occur if the endpoint was set to automatically answer a voice, VTC, or collaboration call with audio and video capabilities enabled, or if the endpoint was compromised and remotely controlled. The stated requirements and mitigations involve muting the microphone(s) and disabling or covering the camera(s).\n\nThese or similar vulnerabilities could exist in PC based communications/collaboration applications due to an auto answer feature or compromised application or platform. As such, the simplest mitigation would be to only operate the software that accesses the microphone and camera when they are needed for communication. This does not work well for a unified communications application that is used to enhance our communications/collaboration capabilities since the application would be running most, if not all of the time when the PC is operating. In this case, the microphone could be muted and camera disabled in software as a mitigation. However, this also may not work well due to the possibility of the communications/collaboration application, microphone, or camera could be remotely activated if the platform or a communications application is compromised.  In this case positive physical controls may be required. We must also rely on our defense in depth strategy for protecting our PC applications, including our communications applications, from compromise. \n\nPhysical disablement such as unplugging from the PC, using a physical mute switch, or covering a camera could work if using external devices. However, this mitigation would not work for embedded microphones and cameras as is the trend in laptops and monitors today.

While this degrades the protections afforded a hardware based system, the trend is to use more and more PC based communications applications due to their advanced features, collaborative benefits, and perceived reduced cost. This soft-phone use case results in the elimination of hardware based telephones on user’s desks in the workplace. This can be seen as, or result in, trading down (from a hardware based system) with regard to availability, reliability, and quality of service since the data network is generally more susceptible to compromise from many sources inside and outside the local LAN making the soft-phones more exposed to attack. This also means that there will be no telephone available in the workspace if the PC is not powered on, or the application is not loaded, or the PC is not fully functional. While this is undesirable from an IA standpoint, a business case can be developed to support it. NOTE: The recommended relationship between PC soft-phone/UC applications and hardware based endpoints in the normal work area is that the PC application should augment the functionality of, or be a backup to, the hardware based instrument in the user’s workspace. The implementation of PC soft-phones or UC applications in the user work space as their only endpoint has several ramifications that must be considered. The following is a list of some of these: • The PC becomes a single point of failure for communications services provided to a user in their workspace. A widespread problem, which affects many PCs or the network infrastructure, may disable all communications for many users at one time. Users may not even have a means to report the failure without using an alternate communications system. A fast spreading worm or power outage could create such a situation. While some may argue that “users can call on their cell phones”, service may not be available or their use may not be permitted in the facility. This translates into the following: - The loss of functionality and efficiency as in lost time due to the inability to communicate when the PC or soft-phone application is not running or functioning properly. • The protections afforded hardware based endpoints by the use of the voice protection zone such as VoIP VLAN(s), and others are missing for soft-phones in a widespread use/implementation scenario and, depending on the implementation on the PC, may degrade the protections afforded hardware based endpoints. Such is the case for all software based communications endpoints since they are typically implemented on all PCs and therefore will be connected to the data VLANs. Assured service for voice traffic will be degraded from that obtained with hardware based instruments connected in the voice protection zone. This translates into the following additional IA measures required to protect the VoIP infrastructure (e.g., a firewall between the VoIP and data VLANs). • The hardware based endpoint is not available for use in parallel with, or in place of, the PC. This can be a problem if the PC is having performance or operational issues, is turned off, or is unavailable. Accessing help desk services requiring logging onto the PC to use the voice services and work on a problem could be a real challenge. Rebooting the PC to clear a problem would disconnect the call to the helpdesk. Accessing voice mail or answering the phone while the PC is booting is made impossible reducing efficiency, particularly when the user starts their day. If the user has C2 responsibilities, the IP equivalent of MLPP cannot function properly if application or PC is unavailable. Precedence calls will not be received by the user but will be transferred to their designated alternate answering point. • Emergency communications could be unavailable if the PC is not booted, the communications application is not running, or either is otherwise compromised. Voice communications must be readily available for life safety and medical reasons, as well as other facility security emergencies. A partial mitigation for this in a “soft-phone world” is to place common use hardware telephones within a short distance (e.g., 30 to 50 feet) of every workspace which is an additional cost. This additional distance however, could be an issue in a medical emergency where a worker might be alone in their workspace and their PC or voice communications application not functioning properly, they may not be able to reach the common use instrument depending upon the nature of the medical emergency. If the worker was suffering a heart attack or diabetic emergency, they could die. Business cases therefore need to include the cost of insurance and/or law suites for this eventuality. • The previous 2 items translate into the following: - The addition of common use hardware based instruments placed around the facility (for backup and emergency usage) along with the additionally required LAN cabling and access switch ports. While some may feel that this is not an IA issue, in reality it is since the discussion is truly about availability, which is one of the prime tenets of IA. Additionally, the VoIP controllers (i.e., the equipment that controls the telephone system) must be able to be accessed by the PC soft-phones while being protected as they would be in a normal VoIP system using hardware based instruments.

These measures are designed to protect the VVoIP service and infrastructure to the greatest extent possible in the event there is a compromise of an OS or application on a workstation or server attached to the data side of the LAN. If this occurs, the compromised platform could be used by an adversary to compromise the VVoIP communications or its supporting infrastructure. Such compromise can happen rather easily, particularly when a server is a web or application server or a workstation is used for web surfing or email. A secondary reason for the implementation of the LAN architecture and security measures defined is to help protect the confidentiality and integrity of the supported VVoIP communications. Based on these two reasons, the defined VVoIP architecture serves to segregate and hide the VVoIP communications and infrastructure (to the greatest extent possible on a converged LAN) from the data workstation users and associated platforms. While VVoIP systems deployed on a strategic B/C/P/S provide a combination of general business or administrative communications along with C2 communications, tactical deployments primarily support C2 communications. There is nowhere other than a tactical deployment that the availability, confidentiality, and integrity of a VVoIP communications service is as critical. Therefore the network supporting a tactical VVoIP communications system must follow the same guidelines as a network supporting a strategic VVoIP system or application. \n\nNOTE: Initial deployments may include as little as a half dozen workstations or as many as fifty. Once the initial deployment is in place, the network may grow and become relatively permanent as would be the case for a rear command or logistics center. \nNOTE: A shipboard LAN is minimally considered as a fixed tactical LAN but can also be considered as a Strategic LAN.

In general all VVoIP systems should be configured the same and such that the service and supporting infrastructure is protected.

Under Applicability and Scope, it states “This Instruction applies to the hardware or software for sending and receiving voice, data, or video signals across a network that provides customer voice, data, or video equipment access to the DSN, DRSN or PSTN.” Additional statements in this section expand this to most devices or systems that are associated with providing telecommunications service. \n\nThe purpose of this testing is twofold. One aspect is to determine if a vendor’s product or system meets DoD functional requirements and that it can interoperate with established or existing DoD systems. The other aspect is to determine if the system can be configured to meet DoD IA requirements and operate at an acceptable level of risk. A product must be approved under both categories before listing on the APL.  \n\nDoD components are required to fulfill their communications needs by only purchasing APL listed products, providing one of the listed products meets their needs. This means the APL must be consulted prior to purchasing a system or product. If no listed product meets the organization’s needs, they may sponsor a product for testing that does meet their needs. \n\nNOTE: The APL as created by this instruction was originally called the DSN APL and covered dial-up telecommunications systems or products providing unclassified communications. It has been expanded to cover additional types of approved products and has been renamed to the Unified Capabilities APL by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (OASD) for Networks and Information Integration (NII). Additional categories have been implemented for DRSN (classified communications) related systems/products and for IPv6 capable products. The APL can be found at http://jitc.fhu.disa.mil/apl/index.html. This APL is referred to as the DoD APL or UC APL. \n\nTactical use cases or systems that do not provide access to the DSN, DRSN or PSTN which are private closed communications systems, may be accredited via the Information Support Plan (ISP) or Tailored Information Support Plan (TISP) process managed by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Joint Staff J6I, and the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) United States (US) Military Communications Electronics Board (USMCEB) Interoperability Test Panel (ITP). \n\nThis policy applies directly to any PC communications application that provides voice communications services to and/or from the DSN, DRSN/VoSIP, or PSTN.

We rely on these services being available when they are needed. Additionally, it is critical that phone service is available in the event of an emergency situation such as a security breach or life safety event. The capability or ability to place calls to emergency services must be maintained. While the DoD voice and data networks are designed to be extremely reliable, such that continuity of operations (COOP) is supported, there is the potential that a site’s EIs will loose the availability to communicate or signal with the LSC or MFSS. Reality is that if signaling messages cannot reach a LSC or MFSS, calls cannot be established. This is an issue even though the LSC and MFSS are specified to provide 5 9s availability; there are many other factors that affect the availability of these central devices. Natural disasters or physical damage to the network connections and/or pathways are just some. The following are considerations for meeting this requirement: \n• Large sites and Intranets: \n•• Redundancy of platforms – Two or more LSC controllers clustered o  Geographic diversity in locating the multiple LSCs within the site or Intranet \n• Small Sites (not dual homed): \n•• A single local subtended LSC may use a LSC to which it is subtended as the backup LSC for call control in the event the local LSC goes down. The best method for meeting this requirement on a large site is to implement redundancy for the LSC and the LSC portion of a MFSS. These redundant devices would then be located in redundant and geographically diverse facilities and connected to different parts of the LAN or CAN. This would mean that two core locations would be established within the site/enclave. LSCs and the LSC portion of a MFSS may be implemented on redundant platforms to meet the 5 9s availability requirements. Potentially these internally redundant devices might be able to be decomposed and located in the redundant facilities. Additional protections are needed for the communications between these decomposed elements. Additionally, each portion of the decomposed elements would need to be able to function on its own. In the event a site/enclave supports multiple tenants and one or more of these tenants have their own LSC, the main site could establish a COOP relationship with the tenant LSC and vise versa. An alternate method might be to establish a COOP relationship to a LSC or MFSS in another site or enclave. The issue with this arrangement is that the interconnection between sites is vulnerable and should be redundant with potentially COOP relationships with multiple LSCs at multiple sites. The best method for an Intranet served by a central LSC or MFSS is to place redundant LSCs in redundant and geographically diverse facilities which are then connected to different parts of the Intranet.

In traditional telecommunications systems the need for backup power is the same but it can be met generally at a single location, which is the phone switch location. The power required by the endpoints is generally provided by the phone switch to maintain basic dial tone services even though some “digital and feature phones require a local power supply. This is not possible in an IP/LAN based VVoIP network because the LAN infrastructure is geographically spread out to be within 100m cabling distance from each LAN endpoint. As such, the power, both primary and backup, must follow the NE to its location. Centrally located core equipment must also have a central uninterruptible power supply (UPS). The endpoints also need continuous power to maintain service. IP telephony endpoints require power to operate. This can be provided locally with a power brick (a small plug-in power adaptor/supply) and an AC outlet or can be provided by the LAN using Power Over Ethernet (POE) technologies. The UPS providing backup power to the LAN access switch can also provide backup power to the endpoint via POE if properly sized. If this is not the case, an individual UPS is required for each instrument supporting special C2 and C2 users of the proper capacity. Policy sets the minimum requirements for the backup power supplied to the VVoIP systems and the supporting LAN and VVoIP endpoints with emphasis on supporting C2 communications when primary power is lost. While this is a very valid case, it is also best practice, if not critical, to provide some level of backup power to the core systems, LAN, and endpoints that only support C2R and non-C2/admin users to support some level of reliable/survivable service, especially for emergency life-safety and security calls. NOTE: The requirement here for UPS support for C2R or Non-C2/admin users communications is negated in the event that such users have an alternate reliable means of communicating in such situations. Personal and potentially even government provided cell phones are not the answer since there are many locations in DoD facilities where they are prohibited and/or signal availability is unreliable. An alternative to this could be to put a policy and SOP into effect that requires such users to evacuate the facility to a location where the appropriate communications capability is available. The policy excerpts driving this requirement are as follows: From the UCR 5.3.1.7.5 Power Backup [Required: ASLAN – Conditional: Non-ASLAN] To meet CJCS requirements for assured services, equipment serving special C2 and C2 users must be provided with backup power. The ASLAN must meet the power requirements outlined at a minimum as follows: Special C2: The ASLAN must provide an 8-hour backup capability in the event of primary power loss to special C2 users. Any ASLAN product, Core, Distribution, or Access that supplies service to the special C2 user must have an 8-hour UPS. 2. C2: The ASLAN must provide 2 hour backup capability in the event of primary power loss to C2 users. Any ASLAN product, core, distribution or access, that supplies service to the C2 user must have a 2 hour uninterruptible power system (UPS). 3. C2(R) or Non-C2: C2(R) or non-C2 users may lose telephony service in the event of a power failure. NOTE: Backup Power (Environmental). The backup power system shall have the capacity to operate environmental systems needed to sustain continuous equipment operation. Power to the environmental systems may not need to be continuous. From CJCSI 6215.01C Appendix A Enclosure C Based on the GIG MA ICD requirements associated with availability and reliability, the following requirements shall be met by IP based RTS. (a) Availability requirement for equipment/software serving Special C2 users is 0.99999 with eight hours uninterrupted power supply. (b) Availability requirement for equipment/software serving C2 users is 0.99997 with two hours uninterrupted power supply. (c) Availability requirement for equipment/software serving C2 users that are authorized to originate Routine ONLY (C2R) and non C2/admin users is 0.999 with no uninterrupted power supply. NOTE: While current DoD policy dictates that the VVoIP system as a whole only provide C2 and C2R users with specific durations of continued service during a power failure (as a cost saving measure), it is highly recommended that the entire system be provided some level of UPS. Traditional phone service is generally always available in a power failure since the endpoint or subscriber instrument is powered from the telephone switch. While there are exceptions to this regarding feature phones and some digital phones that need local power, for the most part all analog phones and others powered by the switch always work when local power is out. As noted above, VVoIP service is subject to disruption if power to the LAN infrastructure is disrupted. This can happen at various points since the LAN is a distributed (non-centralized) network. When implementing a VVoIP system without considering UPS power needs for the VVoIP controllers and endpoints as well as entire LAN, and supporting those needs with UPSs, we are reducing the availability of the telecommunications service that we are accustomed to.'\n  desc 'check', 'Interview the IAO to confirm compliance with the following requirement: \nEnsure an uninterruptible power supply (battery at a minimum; plus optional generator) is provided for all parts of the VVoIP infrastructure (Core LSC/MFSS, adjunct systems providing critical services, EBC, CER,  LAN NEs, and endpoints as follows:\n> All VVoIP system devices including voice endpoints and portions of the LAN that directly support any single special-C2 user are minimally provided 8 hours UPS.\n> All VVoIP system devices including voice endpoints and portions of the LAN that directly supports any single C2 user are minimally provided 2 hours UPS.\n> All VVoIP system devices including voice endpoints and portions of the LAN that supports C2R and non-C2/admin users (that is the balance of the VVoIP system) are provided some reasonable level (minimum 15 minutes / target 30 to 60 minutes) of UPS in support of emergency life-safety and security communications. \n> UPS systems supplying power to infrastructure that supports special-C2 and C2 users must also support environmental power (for example cooling power) such that equipment failures are prevented.

The UPS providing backup power to the LAN access switch can also provide backup power to the endpoint via POE if properly sized. If this is not the case, an individual UPS is required for each instrument supporting special C2 and C2 users of the proper capacity. Policy sets the minimum requirements for the backup power supplied to the VVoIP systems and the supporting LAN and VVoIP endpoints with emphasis on supporting C2 communications when primary power is lost. While this is a very valid case, it is also best practice, if not critical, to provide some level of backup power to the core systems, LAN, and endpoints that only support C2R and non-C2/admin users to support some level of reliable/survivable service, especially for emergency life-safety and security calls. NOTE: The requirement here for UPS support for C2R or Non-C2/admin users communications is negated in the event that such users have an alternate reliable means of communicating in such situations. Personal and potentially even government provided cell phones are not the answer since there are many locations in DoD facilities where they are prohibited and/or signal availability is unreliable. An alternative to this could be to put a policy and SOP into effect that requires such users to evacuate the facility to a location where the appropriate communications capability is available. The policy excerpts driving this requirement are as follows: From the UCR 5.3.1.7.5 Power Backup [Required: ASLAN – Conditional: Non-ASLAN] To meet CJCS requirements for assured services, equipment serving special C2 and C2 users must be provided with backup power. The ASLAN must meet the power requirements outlined at a minimum as follows: Special C2: The ASLAN must provide an 8-hour backup capability in the event of primary power loss to special C2 users. Any ASLAN product, Core, Distribution, or Access that supplies service to the special C2 user must have an 8-hour UPS. 2. C2: The ASLAN must provide 2 hour backup capability in the event of primary power loss to C2 users. Any ASLAN product, core, distribution or access, that supplies service to the C2 user must have a 2 hour uninterruptible power system (UPS). 3. C2(R) or Non-C2: C2(R) or non-C2 users may lose telephony service in the event of a power failure. NOTE: Backup Power (Environmental). The backup power system shall have the capacity to operate environmental systems needed to sustain continuous equipment operation. Power to the environmental systems may not need to be continuous. From CJCSI 6215.01C Appendix A Enclosure C Based on the GIG MA ICD requirements associated with availability and reliability, the following requirements shall be met by IP based RTS. (a) Availability requirement for equipment/software serving Special C2 users is 0.99999 with eight hours uninterrupted power supply. (b) Availability requirement for equipment/software serving C2 users is 0.99997 with two hours uninterrupted power supply. (c) Availability requirement for equipment/software serving C2 users that are authorized to originate Routine ONLY (C2R) and non C2/admin users is 0.999 with no uninterrupted power supply. NOTE: While current DoD policy dictates that the VVoIP system as a whole only provide C2 and C2R users with specific durations of continued service during a power failure (as a cost saving measure), it is highly recommended that the entire system be provided some level of UPS. Traditional phone service is generally always available in a power failure since the endpoint or subscriber instrument is powered from the telephone switch. While there are exceptions to this regarding feature phones and some digital phones that need local power, for the most part all analog phones and others powered by the switch always work when local power is out. As noted above, VVoIP service is subject to disruption if power to the LAN infrastructure is disrupted. This can happen at various points since the LAN is a distributed (non-centralized) network. When implementing a VVoIP system without considering UPS power needs for the VVoIP controllers and endpoints as well as entire LAN, and supporting those needs with UPSs, we are reducing the availability of the telecommunications service that we are accustomed to.","descriptions":{"default":"An uninterruptible power source for the LAN and VVoIP infrastructure is a necessity for the continued survivability, availability, and reliability of the VVoIP services. In traditional telecommunications systems the need for backup power is the same but it can be met generally at a single location, which is the phone switch location. The power required by the endpoints is generally provided by the phone switch to maintain basic dial tone services even though some “digital and feature phones require a local power supply. This is not possible in an IP/LAN based VVoIP network because the LAN infrastructure is geographically spread out to be within 100m cabling distance from each LAN endpoint. As such, the power, both primary and backup, must follow the NE to its location. Centrally located core equipment must also have a central uninterruptible power supply (UPS).

This method includes or supports providing precedence and priority capabilities for C2 users similar to the MLPP service provided by the traditional TDM based DSN. The enclave’s internal LAN is required to be designed to be non-blocking. That is it must provide ample bandwidth for all the traffic that it is expected to carry. This is controllable by DoD. On the other hand, the DISN Core is designed to have ample bandwidth and expandability to support what ever traffic the DoD enclaves throw at it. As such it is considered to be bandwidth rich. Due to issues surrounding the ability for an attached enclave to determine the bandwidth availability or congestion conditions within the core in real time, an assumption has to be made that the DISN Core is also non-blocking. The DISN Core bandwidth is also controllable by DoD. The portion of the overall DISN network that is bandwidth constrained is the TDM or optical OCx access circuits between the local enclave and the DISN Core. This is the portion of the network where we have the least control over bandwidth availability, primarily due to the cost of these circuits. The cost factor is an issue since many DISN access circuits must rely on commercial carriers for some portion of the overall circuit. This is typically the portion that delivers the DISN service to the B/C/P/S. Access circuit issues are less of an issue if the B/C/P/S also provides a home for one of the DISN Core SDNs. This is because a direct connection can be made between the CER and the SDN, however, the circuit capacity may still be an issue if the SDN is a small one that does not have an AR or PE. Due to the nature of digital transmission over these bandwidth constrained circuits, the quality and availability of the communications is degraded as these circuits become congested. “Data” packets can wait until processed without negatively affecting the delivery of a message. This is not the case for VVoIP due to its time sensitive nature (it is a real time service). If VVoIP packets have to wait for transmission, the quality of the call suffers. In IA terms, this relates to the availability of the service and quality communications. To overcome the bandwidth constraints inherent in WAN access circuits, an engineered bandwidth budget must be developed for each service (voice, video, and data) using the circuit. Voice and video budgets are developed in terms of call or session counts. For example, the UCR defines a voice call as follows: “One voice session budget unit shall be equivalent to 110 kilobits per second (kbps) of access circuit bandwidth independent of the EI codec used. This includes ITUT Recommendation G.711 encoding rate plus Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) packet overhead plus ASLAN Ethernet overhead. IPv6 overhead, not IPv4 overhead, is used to determine bandwidth equivalents here.” \n\nNOTE: This budget is unidirectional and must be doubled for bi-directional communications sessions. \n\nNOTE: The VoIP budget covers the following types of services: Voice VoIP, FoIP, MoIP, or SCIP over IP calls The UCR also defines a video call as follows: “Since the bandwidth of a video session can vary [depending upon video resolution (ed)], video sessions will be budgeted in terms of video session units (VSUs). One VSU equals 500 kbps and bandwidth for video sessions will be allocated in multiples of VSUs. For example, the bandwidth allocated to video sessions may be 500 kbps, 1000 kbps, and 2500 kbps. Thus, a video session that requires 2500 kbps will be allocated five VSUs.” \n\nNOTE: This discussion, as it relates to video, is in regard to video sessions controlled by the LSC using AS-SIP for the signaling protocol. H.323 signaled video and/or VTC sessions must be considered separately and potentially have their own budget for access circuit bandwidth. \n\nNOTE: This budget (which also includes the audio component) is unidirectional and must be doubled for bi-directional communications sessions. When developing the bandwidth budgets, the engineer must determine how many simultaneous voice and video calls/sessions are to be supported by the access circuit based upon the unit per call defined in the UCR. The bandwidth budget to be reserved for voice is then calculated along with a budget for video. Next the engineer must determine what percentage of the overall access circuit bandwidth these reserved budgets should consume. The access circuit is then sized (ordered) to accommodate the needs. It is not recommended that IP voice and video capabilities be added to an existing circuit since this would mean the call/session counts would have to be restricted or the data budget would have to be squeezed. \n\nNOTE: Data traffic is permitted to surge into the voice and video budgets if the bandwidth is available; however the voice and video budgets are reserved and will be reclaimed if needed. Voice and video is not permitted to surge into the data budget since ASAC needs a fixed call count to be effective. \n\nNOTE: Instructions for determining voice call budgets for a DISN WAN access circuit can be found in the UCR section 5.3.3.11 Provisioning'\n  desc 'check', 'Interview the IAO to confirm compliance with the following requirement: \n\nIn the event the VVoIP system connects to the DISN WAN for VVoIP transport between enclaves AND the system is intended to provide assured service communications to any level of C2 user (Special C2, C2, C2(R)), ensure Session Admission Control (SAC) for the DISN Core access circuit(s) is supported by engineered bandwidth budgets for VoIP and Video calls/sessions in support of Assured Service.\nNOTE: SAC in support of Assured Service is also referred to as Assured Service Admission Control (ASAC)\nNOTE: The VoIP budget covers the following types of services: Voice VoIP, FoIP, MoIP, or SCIP over IP calls\nNOTE: Per call/session units are defined in the UCR and are unidirectional.

IPv6 overhead, not IPv4 overhead, is used to determine bandwidth equivalents here.” \n\nNOTE: This budget is unidirectional and must be doubled for bi-directional communications sessions. \n\nNOTE: The VoIP budget covers the following types of services: Voice VoIP, FoIP, MoIP, or SCIP over IP calls The UCR also defines a video call as follows: “Since the bandwidth of a video session can vary [depending upon video resolution (ed)], video sessions will be budgeted in terms of video session units (VSUs). One VSU equals 500 kbps and bandwidth for video sessions will be allocated in multiples of VSUs. For example, the bandwidth allocated to video sessions may be 500 kbps, 1000 kbps, and 2500 kbps. Thus, a video session that requires 2500 kbps will be allocated five VSUs.” \n\nNOTE: This discussion, as it relates to video, is in regard to video sessions controlled by the LSC using AS-SIP for the signaling protocol. H.323 signaled video and/or VTC sessions must be considered separately and potentially have their own budget for access circuit bandwidth. \n\nNOTE: This budget (which also includes the audio component) is unidirectional and must be doubled for bi-directional communications sessions. When developing the bandwidth budgets, the engineer must determine how many simultaneous voice and video calls/sessions are to be supported by the access circuit based upon the unit per call defined in the UCR. The bandwidth budget to be reserved for voice is then calculated along with a budget for video. Next the engineer must determine what percentage of the overall access circuit bandwidth these reserved budgets should consume. The access circuit is then sized (ordered) to accommodate the needs. It is not recommended that IP voice and video capabilities be added to an existing circuit since this would mean the call/session counts would have to be restricted or the data budget would have to be squeezed. \n\nNOTE: Data traffic is permitted to surge into the voice and video budgets if the bandwidth is available; however the voice and video budgets are reserved and will be reclaimed if needed. Voice and video is not permitted to surge into the data budget since ASAC needs a fixed call count to be effective. \n\nNOTE: Instructions for determining voice call budgets for a DISN WAN access circuit can be found in the UCR section 5.3.3.11 Provisioning","descriptions":{"default":"The DISN NIPRNet IPVS PMO has developed a method to provide Assured Service voice and video communications over the bandwidth constrained portion of the DISN. This method includes or supports providing precedence and priority capabilities for C2 users similar to the MLPP service provided by the traditional TDM based DSN. The enclave’s internal LAN is required to be designed to be non-blocking. That is it must provide ample bandwidth for all the traffic that it is expected to carry. This is controllable by DoD. On the other hand, the DISN Core is designed to have ample bandwidth and expandability to support what ever traffic the DoD enclaves throw at it. As such it is considered to be bandwidth rich. Due to issues surrounding the ability for an attached enclave to determine the bandwidth availability or congestion conditions within the core in real time, an assumption has to be made that the DISN Core is also non-blocking. The DISN Core bandwidth is also controllable by DoD. The portion of the overall DISN network that is bandwidth constrained is the TDM or optical OCx access circuits between the local enclave and the DISN Core. This is the portion of the network where we have the least control over bandwidth availability, primarily due to the cost of these circuits. The cost factor is an issue since many DISN access circuits must rely on commercial carriers for some portion of the overall circuit. This is typically the portion that delivers the DISN service to the B/C/P/S. Access circuit issues are less of an issue if the B/C/P/S also provides a home for one of the DISN Core SDNs. This is because a direct connection can be made between the CER and the SDN, however, the circuit capacity may still be an issue if the SDN is a small one that does not have an AR or PE. Due to the nature of digital transmission over these bandwidth constrained circuits, the quality and availability of the communications is degraded as these circuits become congested. “Data” packets can wait until processed without negatively affecting the delivery of a message. This is not the case for VVoIP due to its time sensitive nature (it is a real time service). If VVoIP packets have to wait for transmission, the quality of the call suffers. In IA terms, this relates to the availability of the service and quality communications. To overcome the bandwidth constraints inherent in WAN access circuits, an engineered bandwidth budget must be developed for each service (voice, video, and data) using the circuit. Voice and video budgets are developed in terms of call or session counts. For example, the UCR defines a voice call as follows: “One voice session budget unit shall be equivalent to 110 kilobits per second (kbps) of access circuit bandwidth independent of the EI codec used. This includes ITUT Recommendation G.711 encoding rate plus Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) packet overhead plus ASLAN Ethernet overhead.

In DoD, these communications can also include requests for Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF), explosive ordnance disposal, and similar emergency situations specific to the military. The inability of first responders to automatically locate the caller threatens life safety and facility protection or security. Contacting emergency services via the public telephone system has been mandated for many years in the US and other countries around the world. In the US, the FCC has mandated various aspects of providing enhanced F&ES communications and also relies upon state legislation to extend these rules. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules primarily address public communications service providers including traditional LEC and CLECs, mobile communications providers, and VoIP communications providers. \n\nDoD Instruction 6055.06, DoD Fire and Emergency Services (F&ES) Program, provides DoD policy regarding emergency services and emergency services communications. The document primarily discusses fire protection, with specific provisions for telecommunications support for fire, medical, and security emergencies. Private telephone systems, in general, provide a large portion of the required telecommunication capability. All DoD private telephone systems, VoIP or traditional must support enhanced emergency services communications for the completion of emergency calls. Per DoD Instruction 6055.06, all sites must support, provide for, and implement F&ES telecommunications services. When implementing basic F&ES telecommunications services, each country or region designates a specific standard telephone number or prefix code to be dialed that can be easily remembered by the public. In some instances, while not best practice, organizations might designate an internal emergency number for use within their telephone system. Examples of such numbers are as follows: \n- 911 in North America \n- 112 in the EU and UK \n- 000 in Australia \n\nIssues may arise when an emergency call is originated through a private telephone system, such as a traditional PBX or a VVoIP system. While the LEC or CLEC may properly route the call in a priority manner, the same may not be true for the private system unless specificity addressed in the systems call routing tables and potentially other system features. As such, the private system must be configured to properly handle emergency communications. Enhanced F&ES communications permits the answering station to automatically locate the caller. This is particularly helpful when the caller cannot provide their location themselves. \n\nEnhanced F&ES communications are mandated by the FCC and state legislation. Current implementation is a best practice. The enhanced F&ES communications capability is enabled using Automatic Number Identification (ANI) and Phone Switch Automatic Location Identification (PS-ALI) information. ANI provides the telephone number of the calling party and is generated by the telephone system. PS-ALI associates the calling party’s number (ANI information) with their location or registered address of the phone being used. PS-ALI is provided by a database maintained within the telephone system or externally. In many cases, the F&ES answering service system will use the PS-ALI information to map the location of the calling phone. VoIP phones, on the other hand, can be connected anywhere in the world and function. This is an issue for commercial VoIP services which is being addressed by the FCC. ALI information in the private sector must be handled by the owners/operators of private telephone system. When a private telephone system supports enhanced F&ES telecommunications, a PS-ALI database must be instituted, maintained, and kept current as endpoints and numbers move at a site. \n\nNOTE: For fire and emergency services, the requirements are for the site.

The design and implementation of all telephone system systems must include reasonable efforts to provide E911, even when the access connection to the Enterprise LSC is severed.\n\nPublic enhanced F&ES systems are implemented in conjunction with the local exchange carrier (LEC) using their central office switch (CO). When the designated F&ES number is dialed, the CO routes the call to the public F&ES answering point (PSAP) over special trunks that can provide the PSAP with the telephone number from which the emergency call originated and the geographic location of the originating telephone. The originating telephone number is provided as Automatic Number Identification (ANI) information. The geographic location of the originating telephone is provided as Automatic Location Identification (ALI) information. The ALI is generated from the ANI by looking up the ANI in a database. Typically this function is performed by the LEC and the ALI provided is the service delivery address for the telephone number. In some cases the ALI information is housed in a database at the PSAP or a at a third party provider such that the PSAP must make the “database dip” to identify the location of the caller. The information is regularly updated by the LEC based on new service deliveries and disconnections.\n\nThis process does not go far enough if the originating telephone is behind (part of) a DoD telephone system. A DoD telephone system may serve a large building or may serve multiple buildings in a campus setting. It may also serve small or large remote sites that are geographically distant from the main telephone system switch. As discussed above, the normal process provides the address where the LEC delivers its phone service for the calling number. While this address will serve to get emergency services personnel to the lobby of a building or the front gate of a campus, it will not provide the exact location of the caller. This is where the federal and state telephone system related requirements come in. Under these rules, a telephone system operator and the system itself must provide complete ANI and ALI information to the answering point such that emergency services personnel can easily locate the caller. As such the telephone system must provide the exact location of the originating telephone minimally within a reasonably small area of it. The location information provided for telephones behind a telephone system is called Phone Switch-ALI (PS-ALI). \n\nTo implement this, the telephone system must first be able to provide the F&ES answering station with the telephone number from which the emergency call originated via ANI. If the answering point is outside the telephone system, the number provided must be the exact Direct Inward Dialing (DID) number of the telephone placing the call so that the answering point can dial it directly. The number provided must not be that of an outbound trunk. Secondly, this phone number must be correlated to its physical address or location within the facility via PS-ALI. \n\nTo implement PS-ALI, the owner/operator of a telephone system is responsible for maintaining an up-to-date database containing the telephone number (DID number and/or extension number) and physical location of each telephone attached to the telephone system. This database is then used to provide the PS-ALI information to the ALI database(s) accessed by the F&ES answering point. In association with each telephone and telephone number in the telephone system, the PS-ALI information contained in the database includes the following: \n- The address of the site containing the telephone system unless provided to the answering point by the LEC as part of its ANI/ALI information.\n- The name (or number) of the building in which the telephone is located.\n- The address of the building in which the telephone is located.\n- The floor in the building on which the telephone is located.\n- The area or quadrant of the floor where the telephone is located.\n- The room or cube number where the telephone is located.\n\nAdditional information should be provided to the F&ES answering point and emergency services personnel in the form of up-to-date facility maps and floor plans. The maintenance of facility maps, floor plans, and PS-ALI information to keep them up-to-date is critical to life safety and facility protection and security. This can be an onerous process in light of changes in the facility and moves, adds, and changes within the telephone system. Maintaining accurate location information is exacerbated in a VoIP telephone system due to the ability of an IP phone to change its physical location within the LAN (and possibly beyond) while keeping its telephone number without specific intervention from, or knowledge of the telephone system operator. As such the PS_ALI database can quickly become inaccurate. A situation that could be life threatening. \n\nAutomated systems can be used with a VoIP system and LAN to identify the general location of an IP phone within the facility based on the LAN switch and port to which the phone is connected. Once this information is obtained from the LAN, it is correlated with the documented location of the LAN switch and documented location of the outlet served by the switchport.'\n  desc 'check', 'Interview the ISSO to validate compliance with the following requirement: \nInspect the telephone system configuration or external database to determine compliance with the requirement.

This can be an onerous process in light of changes in the facility and moves, adds, and changes within the telephone system. Maintaining accurate location information is exacerbated in a VoIP telephone system due to the ability of an IP phone to change its physical location within the LAN (and possibly beyond) while keeping its telephone number without specific intervention from, or knowledge of the telephone system operator. As such the PS_ALI database can quickly become inaccurate. A situation that could be life threatening. \n\nAutomated systems can be used with a VoIP system and LAN to identify the general location of an IP phone within the facility based on the LAN switch and port to which the phone is connected. Once this information is obtained from the LAN, it is correlated with the documented location of the LAN switch and documented location of the outlet served by the switchport.","descriptions":{"default":"Under FCC rules and the laws of some states, the implementation of Enhanced F&ES telecommunications services requires that the emergency services answering point or call center must be automatically provided with enough location information so that emergency services personnel can locate the calling party within a specified radius at their exact location in the event they are unable provide their location themselves. This is a two-part process that is exacerbated if the call originates from a DoD telephone system). Some of the FCC rules and state laws address the telephone system issue. For enterprise systems, the support for E911 by the enterprise LSC (or any remote LSC construct) is governed by FCC rules, as well as other federal, state, and local law. The design and implementation of all telephone system systems must include reasonable efforts to provide E911, even when the access connection to the Enterprise LSC is severed.\n\nPublic enhanced F&ES systems are implemented in conjunction with the local exchange carrier (LEC) using their central office switch (CO). When the designated F&ES number is dialed, the CO routes the call to the public F&ES answering point (PSAP) over special trunks that can provide the PSAP with the telephone number from which the emergency call originated and the geographic location of the originating telephone. The originating telephone number is provided as Automatic Number Identification (ANI) information. The geographic location of the originating telephone is provided as Automatic Location Identification (ALI) information. The ALI is generated from the ANI by looking up the ANI in a database. Typically this function is performed by the LEC and the ALI provided is the service delivery address for the telephone number. In some cases the ALI information is housed in a database at the PSAP or a at a third party provider such that the PSAP must make the “database dip” to identify the location of the caller. The information is regularly updated by the LEC based on new service deliveries and disconnections.\n\nThis process does not go far enough if the originating telephone is behind (part of) a DoD telephone system. A DoD telephone system may serve a large building or may serve multiple buildings in a campus setting. It may also serve small or large remote sites that are geographically distant from the main telephone system switch. As discussed above, the normal process provides the address where the LEC delivers its phone service for the calling number. While this address will serve to get emergency services personnel to the lobby of a building or the front gate of a campus, it will not provide the exact location of the caller. This is where the federal and state telephone system related requirements come in. Under these rules, a telephone system operator and the system itself must provide complete ANI and ALI information to the answering point such that emergency services personnel can easily locate the caller. As such the telephone system must provide the exact location of the originating telephone minimally within a reasonably small area of it. The location information provided for telephones behind a telephone system is called Phone Switch-ALI (PS-ALI). \n\nTo implement this, the telephone system must first be able to provide the F&ES answering station with the telephone number from which the emergency call originated via ANI. If the answering point is outside the telephone system, the number provided must be the exact Direct Inward Dialing (DID) number of the telephone placing the call so that the answering point can dial it directly. The number provided must not be that of an outbound trunk. Secondly, this phone number must be correlated to its physical address or location within the facility via PS-ALI. \n\nTo implement PS-ALI, the owner/operator of a telephone system is responsible for maintaining an up-to-date database containing the telephone number (DID number and/or extension number) and physical location of each telephone attached to the telephone system. This database is then used to provide the PS-ALI information to the ALI database(s) accessed by the F&ES answering point. In association with each telephone and telephone number in the telephone system, the PS-ALI information contained in the database includes the following: \n- The address of the site containing the telephone system unless provided to the answering point by the LEC as part of its ANI/ALI information.\n- The name (or number) of the building in which the telephone is located.\n- The address of the building in which the telephone is located.\n- The floor in the building on which the telephone is located.\n- The area or quadrant of the floor where the telephone is located.\n- The room or cube number where the telephone is located.\n\nAdditional information should be provided to the F&ES answering point and emergency services personnel in the form of up-to-date facility maps and floor plans.

These URLs are translated to IP addresses by a DNS server. The use of URLS in this manner permits an endpoint to find the server it is looking for in the event the server’s IP address is changed. This also permits the endpoint to locate its assigned or home call controller from a remote location on a network that is not their home network. While all of this adds flexibility to the system and the endpoint’s location, it also exposes the endpoint and the home system to DNS vulnerabilities. Additionally, the home VVoIP system must expose critical IP address and domain information to the DNS system.

This provides information that can be used to attack or compromise the VVoIP system. \n\nWhen using DNS within a VVoIP system so that endpoints can find various servers in the network, the DNS server should be dedicated to the VVoIP system. Further more this DNS server should have limited or no interaction with the DNS server used by the data portion of the LAN/CAN or a publicly accessible DNS server.

It receives an internal LAN address and therefore becomes a part of the LAN and can directly reach its servers using their IP address. A URL is not required. The only time a URL might be required is in the event the endpoint is required to find a server such as a directory server that is somewhere on the WAN.

If this information is poisoned or if collected and used by an unauthorized unscrupulous individual, the effects to the VoIP environment could be detrimental. Denial-of-service or fraudulent system use are only two of the potential compromises. As such, MGCP messages must be protected from eavesdropping, man in the middle, and replay attacks. To protect MGCP, Request for Comment (RFC) 2705 which defines MGCP outlines and recommends the use of IPsec for encryption and authentication between gateways. This recommendation primarily applies to the use of MGCP across unprotected WANs like the Internet. This extends to use on NIPRNet as well. A follow-on protocol defined jointly by the IETF in RFC 3435 and the ITU-T in Recommendation H.248.1 is MEGACO/H.248 which provides the same general functionality as MGCP. RFC 3435 also requires that H.248 packets be authenticated and/or encrypted using IPsec. Unfortunately there is not widespread support by MGCs and MGs for IPsec protection and therefore we must rely on external IPsec VPNs when traversing the WAN. When confined within the LAN, we can protect MGCP in a number of ways without IPsec.","check":"Request the SA demonstrate the measures used to protect MGCP or MEGACO/H.248 signaling on MGs, MGCs, and other devices such as end instruments if they use MGCP or MEGACO/H.248, by providing configuration details.\n\nWhen the MGCP or MEGACO/H.248 is used to control Media Gateways (MGs) or other devices (e.g., endpoints), the following must be addressed: \n - The LSC/MGC and MG are located in the same protected LSC VLAN and ACLs are established on all VLAN egress points to block the MGCP or MEGACO/H.248 from exiting the VLAN; OR \n - The LSC/MGC and MG are located in adjacent protected VLANs and ACLs are established to permit MGCP or MEGACO/H.248 between the LSC/MGC and MG but block the MGCP or MEGACO/H.248 from exiting these VLANs; AND \n - In the event MGCP or MEGACO/H.248 is used to control a MG or a distributed set of MGs across a WAN, ensure an encrypted VPN is used to protect the MGCP traffic. \n - Additionally, ensure the source of MGCP or MEGACO/H.248 packets is authenticated to originate from a valid source and/or minimally filter acceptance on source IP address.\n\nIf the MGCP and H.248 (MEGACO) are not restricted on the LAN, and protected on the WAN using encryption, OR MGCP and H.248 (MEGACO) packets are not authenticated or filtered by source IP address, this is a finding.","fix":"When the MGCP or MEGACO/H.248 is used to control Media Gateways (MGs) or other devices (e.g., endpoints), the following must be addressed: \n - The LSC/MGC and MG are located in the same protected LSC VLAN and ACLs are established on all VLAN egress points to block the MGCP or MEGACO/H.248 from exiting the VLAN; OR \n - The LSC/MGC and MG are located in adjacent protected VLANs and ACLs are established to permit MGCP or MEGACO/H.248 between the LSC/MGC and MG but block the MGCP or MEGACO/H.248 from exiting these VLANs; AND \n - In the event MGCP or MEGACO/H.248 is used to control a MG or a distributed set of MGs across a WAN, ensure an encrypted VPN is used to protect the MGCP traffic. \n - Additionally, ensure the source of MGCP or MEGACO/H.248 packets is authenticated to originate from a valid source and/or minimally filter acceptance on source IP address."},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-23704r2_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-8224","rid":"SV-8710r2_rule","stig_id":"VVoIP 1405","gtitle":"VVoIP 1405","fix_id":"F-20185r2_fix","documentable":null}},{"id":"SV-8713","code":"control 'SV-8713' do\n  title 'VVoIP system components must use separate address blocks from those used by non-VVoIP system devices.'\n  desc 'VVoIP networks increasingly represent high-value targets for attacks and represent a greater risk to network security than most other network applications; hence, it is imperative that the voice network and supporting data networks be secured as tightly as possible to reduce the impact that an attack can have on either network.

The layer 2 switches found at the access layer provide high port density for both host and IP phone connectivity as well as layer 2 services such as QoS and VLAN membership. (It should also be mentioned that some access layer switches can also do layer 2 and 3 filtering.) Guidelines and requirements for securing access layer devices including any associated cross-connect hardware can be found in the Network Infrastructure STIG. Layer 2 network segregation is the second layer in our layered defense approach to VoIP security. Voice traffic must be isolated from data traffic using separate physical LANs or Virtual LANs. The combination of data and voice segregation and segmentation using VLANs along with a switched infrastructure strongly enhances the security posture of the system. This will also help to mitigate call eavesdropping and other attacks. VLAN technology has traditionally been an efficient way of grouping users into workgroups to share a specific network address space and broadcast domain regardless of their physical location on the network. Hosts within the same VLAN can communicate with other hosts in the same VLAN using layer-2 switching. To communicate with other VLANs, traffic must go through a layer 3 device where it can be filtered and routed. VLANs can offer significant benefits in a multi-service network by providing a convenient way of isolating VVoIP equipment and traffic from the data equipment and traffic. When VLANs are deployed, excessive broadcast and multicast packets present in the normal data traffic will not disrupt IPT services. As with data networks, IPT equipment and instruments should be logically grouped using multiple VLANs such that IP Phones share their VLANs only with other IP Phones, gateways with like gateways, and so on. Each type of VVoIP device would have mutually exclusive VLANs. This forces layer 3 routing and thereby enables all the filtering capabilities of the layer 3 devices. Additionally, each server type should have its own VLAN. Private server VLANs would prevent a compromised server from attacking another server on the same VLAN at layer two. Since all the devices on any given VLAN would have the same Layer 2 through 4 (at least) characteristics the filtering rules become easier to develop, deploy, and manage. Additionally, the implementation of VLANs helps to mitigate the risk of attacks sourced from the data VLANs such as virus driven DoS attack or packet sniffing. In addition, placing voice and data traffic into separate VLANs will reduce competition for the network and thus reduce latency (queue/wait time) for transmission services, which will reduce the possibility of denial of voice services.

Since VoIP is very latency sensitive this segmentation approach is the most economical way to improve performance in an existing network infrastructure.","check":"Interview the ISSO to confirm compliance with the following requirement: \n\nEnsure the VVoIP system and the supporting LAN are designed and implemented using multiple VLANs to segregate the VVoIP core equipment and endpoints and services from all other hosts and services (such as data and dedicated VTC) running on the LAN such that the security, QoS, and reliability of the VVoIP system/service is enhanced thus allowing VVoIP system traffic and access control using router ACLs.\n\nVLANs and subnets will be provided and equipment separated, for those devices that are implemented in the system, as follows:\n> Hardware Endpoints: multiple VLANs generally in parallel with data LAN VLANs the number of which is dependent on the size of the LAN and as required for the reduction of broadcast domains per good LAN design.

Voice and data traffic may coexist on the data VLAN when leaving the workstation. Based on the Unified Capabilities Requirements (UCR) requirement that the Unified Capabilities (UC) application tag its signaling and media traffic with the proper UCR defined Differentiated Service Code Point (DSCP), the LAN access switch port must route the UC traffic to the voice/video VLAN.

These may include desktop and “executive” or office based units. All other Hardware based VTC endpoints require their own dedicated network or VLAN. \n\nNOTE: Separate VLANs work in conjunction with the dedicated address space discussed earlier to provide the required effect. Each VLAN is configured with a subset of addresses (valid IP subnet) from the designated VVoIP address space\nNOTE: Per NI STIG requirements the NE’s default VLAN (VLAN 0 or 1) will not be used for any of the required VVoIP, data, or VTC VLANs.\n\nNOTE: ACLs are required between the various VLANs that will filter traffic between them based on what protocols and IP addresses are permitted to access or control the devices residing in the VLAN. Therefore it is expected that the LAN / VVoIP system design will include one or more routers or layer-3 switches as the intersection of all of these VLANs to access and traffic flow between them. This routing device will be configured with ACLs to only permit the functionally necessary traffic to flow between the various VLANs and the equipment they contain. \n\nNOTE: These VLANs may be replaced by direct connections to the VVoIP core routing devices so that the ACLs may be implemented on the physical interface to the device. This requires that such direct physical connections be given a discrete subnet. \n\nNOTE: The VLAN/subnets and associated ACLs need only to be assigned / applied for devices that exist in the VVoIP system. The VLAN / ACL design may change depending upon the location and physical makeup of the VVoIP core equipment. An example of this is if a MG and SG reside on the same platform and both use the same Ethernet LAN connections (and potentially the same or different IP address), then separate VLANs are not needed for the MG and SG but the ACL protecting them may need to be adjusted accordingly. \n\nThis is a finding in the event the design or implementation of the VVoIP system and supporting LAN does not include the required VLANs and subnets based upon the equipment and services provided by or included in the VVoIP system. Size of the system or the number of users supported has no effect on the need for this segmentation. However under some circumstances such as in the case of a small deployable package the number of VLANs can be reduced based upon a benefit vs. risk assessment, AO approval, and package C&A.\n\nNOTE: The existence of the required VLANs will be validated in subsequent computing checks. The purpose of this check is to determine if the system design and implementation plan includes consideration for VLAN segmentation.","fix":"Deploy VVoIP systems and components on a dedicated VLAN structure that is separate from the data network VLAN structure.

In the event such a system has no need or potential need to communicate with other enclaves that use the DISN VoSIP service, they must utilize their own dedicated IP address space carved out of the address space assigned to their C-LANs by the SIPRNet PMO in accordance with the previously noted requirement.","descriptions":{"default":"A previous requirement states the following: Ensure a different, dedicated, address blocks or ranges are defined for the VVoIP system within the LAN (Enclave) that is separate from the address blocks/ranges used by the rest of the LAN for non VVoIP system devices thus allowing traffic and access control using firewalls and router ACLs. \nNOTE: This is applicable to the following: > A classified LAN connected to a classified WAN (such as the SIPRNet). \n\nNOTE: In the case of a classified WAN where network wide address based accountability or traceability is required by the network PMO, the PMO must provide a segregated, network wide address block(s) so that the attached classified LANs can meet this requirement. DISA provides a world wide VoIP based voice communications service called the DISN Voice over Secret IP (VoSIP) service or just VoSIP for short. This service is managed by the DRSN PMO. This service also provides gateways into the DRSN. In support of the above requirement, the SIPRNet PMO has designated specific dedicated address ranges for use by the DISN VoSIP service and assigned these address blocks to the DRSN/VoSIP PMO for VoSIP address management and assignment. The VoSIP service provides VoIP based communications between VoIP systems within customer’s classified LANs (C-LANs) operating at the secret level while using the SIPRNet WAN for the inter-enclave (inter-LAN) transport. Additionally, the SIPRNet PMO requires network wide address based accountability or traceability based on assigned IP address. As such customer’s SIPRNet connected secret C-LANs utilize addresses assigned by the SIPRNet PMO. Therefore, customers of the DISN VoSIP service must use IP addresses assigned to them by the DRSN/VoSIP PMO when addressing the VoIP controllers and endpoints within their C-LANs.

As such they are considered mission critical and we have become accustomed to their high reliability and availability which is generally on the order of 5 nines. \n\nMany VVoIP systems are based on general-purpose operating systems such as Windows, Unix, LINUX as well as database and web server applications such as MS-SQL, Oracle, IIS, Tomcat, and others. Additionally, vendors of these systems usually customize or only use portions of the general-purpose operating systems and applications. Vendors also use and potentially customize open source software (OSS).\n\nVulnerabilities are discovered every day in these general-purpose operating systems and applications by the community their original vendors.  The vendors of these general-purpose systems and applications (such as Microsoft and others) routinely provide patches for their products to address bugs and vulnerabilities while other vendors and the OSS community provide upgraded versions of the software. These vulnerabilities and their mitigations usually appear in the DOD’s Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process as Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts (IAVAs). The process mandates that these IAVAs be addressed in a specific time frame based on the severity of the issue. Many times the mandated “fix” is to apply the original vendors patch or to upgrade to the “fixed” version of the software that has the vulnerability.\n\nDue to the mission critical nature of our voice telecommunications systems, owners and operators must be cautioned against applying patches to their systems that are provided by the original vendor of the general-purpose operating systems and applications used in their systems as these may severely and adversely affect the operability of a portion of the system or may cause the system to crash. Significant down time could result which would amount to a self imposed denial of service.\n\nTo prevent operability issues and downtime to the greatest extent possible, the VVoIP system vendor must first determine if the OEM vulnerability and mitigating patch is applicable to their system or a portion thereof, and then test the mitigation/patch to validate that it will not degrade the system or its security. The IPT / VoIP vendor may have to modify the OEM patch or produce their own patch before releasing it to their customers. Obtaining a vendor tested and vendor approved patch from the system vendor provides the greatest assurance that responding to an IAVA will not involve a negative impact on the system.\n\nTo aid in this process, VVoIP system vendor must be advised of IAVAs that may apply to their systems. This is best accomplished by asking the vendor if the CVE or OEM patch number noted in the IAVA applies to your system and version of code.

The vendors of these general-purpose systems and applications (such as Microsoft and others) routinely provide patches for their products to address bugs and vulnerabilities while other vendors and the OSS community provide upgraded versions of the software. These vulnerabilities and their mitigations usually appear in the DOD’s Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process as Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts (IAVAs).

Significant down time could result which would amount to a self imposed denial of service.\n\nTo prevent operability issues and downtime to the greatest extent possible, the VVoIP system vendor must first determine if the OEM vulnerability and mitigating patch is applicable to their system or a portion thereof, and then test the mitigation/patch to validate that it will not degrade the system or its security. The IPT / VoIP vendor may have to modify the OEM patch or produce their own patch before releasing it to their customers. Obtaining a vendor tested and vendor approved patch from the system vendor provides the greatest assurance that responding to an IAVA will not involve a negative impact on the system.\n\nTo aid in this process, VVoIP system vendor must be advised of IAVAs that may apply to their systems. This is best accomplished by asking the vendor if the CVE or OEM patch number noted in the IAVA applies to your system and version of code.

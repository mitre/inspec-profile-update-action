RSVP-TE is also used to enable MPLS Fast Reroute, a network restoration mechanism that will reroute traffic onto a backup LSP in case of a node or link failure along the primary path. When there is a disruption in the MPLS core, such as a link flap or router reboot, the result is a significant amount of RSVP signaling, such as \"PathErr\" and \"ResvErr\" messages that need to be sent for every LSP using that link.\n\nWhen RSVP messages are sent out, they are sent either hop by hop or with the router alert bit set in the IP header. This means that every router along the path must examine the packet to determine if additional processing is required for these RSVP messages. If there is enough signaling traffic in the network, it is possible for an interface to receive more packets for its input queue than it can hold, resulting in dropped RSVP messages and hence slower RSVP convergence. Increasing the size of the interface input queue can help prevent dropping packets; however, there is still the risk of having a burst of signaling traffic that can fill the queue. Solutions to mitigate this risk are RSVP message pacing or refresh reduction to control the rate at which RSVP messages are sent.

Zones of the same scope cannot overlap while zones of a smaller scope will fit completely within a zone of a larger scope. For example, Admin-local scope is smaller than Site-local scope, so the administratively configured boundary fits within the bounds of a site. According to RFC 4007 IPv6 Scoped Address Architecture (section 5), scope zones are also required to be \"convex from a routing perspective\"; that is, packets routed within a zone must not pass through any links that are outside of the zone. This requirement forces each zone to be one contiguous island rather than a series of separate islands. \n\nAs stated in the DoD IPv6 IA Guidance for MO3, \"One should be able to identify all interfaces of a zone by drawing a closed loop on their network diagram, engulfing some routers and passing through some routers to include only some of their interfaces.\" Therefore, it is imperative that the network engineers have documented their multicast topology and thereby knows which interfaces are enabled for multicast. Once this is done, the zones can be scoped as required.","check":"Step 1: Review the network's multicast topology diagram.\n\nStep 2:  Review the router configuration to verify that only the PIM interfaces as shown in the multicast topology diagram are enabled for PIM as shown in the example below.\n\ninterface GigabitEthernet1/1\n ip address 10.1.3.3 255.255.255.0\n ip pim sparse-mode\n\nIf an interface is not required to support multicast routing and it is enabled, this is a finding.","fix":"Document all enabled interfaces for PIM in the network's multicast topology diagram.

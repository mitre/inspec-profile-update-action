While PUPs do not typically have any infection capability on their own, they rely on malware or other attack mechanisms to be installed onto target hosts, after which they will collect and transfer data from the host to an external host and/or will be used as attach mechanisms. Configuring the antivirus software to attempt to clean the file first will allow for the possibility of a false positive. If files are backed up before they are repaired, this could possibly allow the infection to stay on the system.","check":"Server check:  From the Symantec Endpoint Protection Management Server, Symantec Endpoint Protection Management Console:  Select Policies -> Double-click the applied policy -> Under Windows Settings, Scheduled Scans -> Select Administrator-Defined Scans -> Double-click the Weekly Scan -> Select the Actions tab -> Under Actions -> Under Security Risks -> Select Remote Access -> Ensure \"Override actions configured for Security Risks\" is NOT selected.\n\nCriteria:  If \"Override actions configured for Security Risks\" is selected, this is a finding.","fix":"From the Symantec Endpoint Protection Management Server, Symantec Endpoint Protection Management Console: Select Policies -> Double-click the applied policy -> Under Windows Settings, Scheduled Scans -> Select Administrator-Defined Scans -> Double-click the Weekly Scan -> Select the Actions tab -> Under Actions -> Under Security Risks -> Select Remote Access -> Ensure \"Override actions configured for Security Risks\" is NOT selected."},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP) 12.x - Managed"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-48990r2_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-42718","rid":"SV-68105r1_rule","stig_id":"DTASEP064","gtitle":"DTASEP064","fix_id":"F-48304r1_fix","documentable":null,"cci":["CCI-001243"],"nist":["SI-3 c 2"]}},{"id":"SV-68107","code":"control 'SV-68107' do\n  title 'The Symantec Endpoint Protection client weekly scheduled scan actions for when a security risk has been detected must be configured to Delete Risk as first action.'\n  desc 'Malware may have infected a file that is necessary to the user.

Protecting log data is important during a forensic investigation to ensure investigators can track and understand what may have occurred. Off-loading should be set up as a scheduled task but can be configured to be run manually, if other processes during the off-loading are manual. Off-loading is a common process in information systems with limited log storage capacity.","check":"At the command prompt, execute the following command:\n\ngrep traceFile /opt/vmware/etc/sfcb/sfcb.cfg\n\nIf the value of \"traceFile\" is not \"syslog', this is a finding.","fix":"Navigate to and open /opt/vmware/etc/sfcb/sfcb.cfg,\n\nConfigure the sfcb.cfg file with the following value: 'traceFile: syslog'"},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target VMware vRealize Automation 7-x vAMI"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-44198r676060_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-240965","rid":"SV-240965r879886_rule","stig_id":"VRAU-VA-000645","gtitle":"SRG-APP-000515-AS-000203","fix_id":"F-44157r676061_fix","documentable":null,"legacy":["SV-100925","V-90275"],"cci":["CCI-001851"],"nist":["AU-4 (1)"]}},{"id":"SV-240966","code":"control 'SV-240966' do\n  title 'The vAMI must be configured to listen on a specific IPv4 address.'\n  desc 'Configuring the application to implement organization-wide security implementation guides and security checklists ensures compliance with federal standards and establishes a common security baseline across DoD that reflects the most restrictive security posture consistent with operational requirements.

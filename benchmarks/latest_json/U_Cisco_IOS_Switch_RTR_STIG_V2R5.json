A general DiffServ principle is to mark or trust traffic as close to the source as administratively and technically possible. However, certain traffic types might need to be re-marked before handoff to the DODIN backbone to gain admission to the correct class. If such re-marking is required, it is recommended that the re-marking be performed at the CE egress edge.\n\nNote: The GTP QOS document (GTP-0009) can be downloaded via the following link: \nhttps://intellipedia.intelink.gov/wiki/Portal:GIG_Technical_Guidance/GTG_GTPs/GTP_Development_List\n\nIf the switch is not configured to enforce a QoS policy in accordance with the QoS GIG Technical Profile, this is a finding.","fix":"Configure to enforce a QoS policy to provide preferred treatment for mission-critical applications.\n\nStep 1: Configure class-maps to match on DSCP values as shown in the configuration example below:\n\nSW1(config)#class-map match-all PREFERRED_DATA\nSW1(config-cmap)#match ip dscp af33\nSW1(config-cmap)#class-map match-all CONTROL_PLANE\nSW1(config-cmap)#match ip dscp cs6\nSW1(config-cmap)#class-map match-all VIDEO\nSW1(config-cmap)#match ip dscp af41\nSW1(config-cmap)#class-map match-all VOICE\nSW1(config-cmap)#match ip dscp ef\nSW1(config-cmap)#class-map match-all C2_VOICE\nSW1(config-cmap)#match ip dscp 47\nSW1(config-cmap)#exit\n\nStep 2: Configure a policy map to be applied to the core-layer-facing interface that reserves the bandwidth for each traffic type as shown in the example below:\n\nSW1(config)#policy-map QOS_POLICY\nSW1(config-pmap)#class CONTROL_PLANE\nSW1(config-pmap-c)#priority percent 10\nSW1(config-pmap-c)#class C2_VOICE\nSW1(config-pmap-c)#priority percent 10\nSW1(config-pmap-c)#class VOICE\nSW1(config-pmap-c)#priority percent 15\nSW1(config-pmap-c)#class VIDEO\nSW1(config-pmap-c)#bandwidth percent 25\nSW1(config-pmap-c)#class PREFERRED_DATA\nSW1(config-pmap-c)#bandwidth percent 25\nSW1(config-pmap-c)#class class-default\nSW1(config-pmap-c)#bandwidth percent 15\nSW1(config-pmap-c)#exit\nSW1(config-pmap)#exit\n\nStep 3: Apply the output service policy to all interfaces as shown in the configuration example below:\n\nSW1(config)#int g1/1\nSW1(config-if)#service-policy output QOS_POLICY\nSW1(config-if)#exit\nSW1(config)#int g1/2\nSW1(config-if)#service-policy output QOS_POLICY\nSW1(config-if)#end"},"impact":0.3,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target Cisco IOS Switch RTR"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-22173r917421_chk","severity":"low","gid":"V-220458","rid":"SV-220458r917423_rule","stig_id":"CISC-RT-000760","gtitle":"SRG-NET-000193-RTR-000113","fix_id":"F-22162r917422_fix","documentable":null,"legacy":["SV-110771","V-101667"],"cci":["CCI-001095"],"nist":["SC-5 (2)"]}},{"id":"SV-220459","code":"control 'SV-220459' do\n  title 'The Cisco P switch must be configured to enforce a Quality-of-Service (QoS) policy to provide preferred treatment for mission-critical applications.'\n  desc 'Different applications have unique requirements and toleration levels for delay, jitter, bandwidth, packet loss, and availability.

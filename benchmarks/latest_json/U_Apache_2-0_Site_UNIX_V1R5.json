The language is often used in shell scripting and is intended to be practical, easy to use, and efficient means of generating interactive web pages for the user. Unfortunately, many widely available freeware PERL programs (scripts) are extremely insecure. This is most readily accomplished by a malicious user substituting input to a PERL script during a POST or a GET operation. \n\nConsequently, the founders of PERL have developed a mechanism named TAINT that protects the system from malicious input sent from outside the program. When the data is tainted, it cannot be used in programs or functions such as eval(), system(), exec(), pipes, or popen(). The script will exit with a warning message. It is vital that if PERL is being used, the following line appear in the first line of PERL scripts:\n\n#!/usr/local/bin/perl –T'\n  desc 'check', \"When a PERL script is invoked for execution on a UNIX server, the method which invokes the script must utilize the TAINT option.\n\nThe server’s interpreter examines the first line of the script.

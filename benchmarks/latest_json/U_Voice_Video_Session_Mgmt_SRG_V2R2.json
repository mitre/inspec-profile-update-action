The H.323 protocol suite relies on the H.235 series, which describes security within H.323, including security for both signaling and media. For SIP protocol, the DoD has created the AS-SIP protocol, which provides for implementing Transport Layer Security (TLS), Multi-Level Precedence and Preemption (MLPP), reliance on Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol (SRTP) for media streams, and Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) for traffic management through priority packet routing. To secure SCCP, TLS must be implemented with the protocol.","check":"Verify the Voice Video Session Manager uses encryption for signaling and media traffic.\n\nIf the Voice Video Session Manager does not use encryption for signaling and media traffic, this is a finding.","fix":"Configure the Voice Video Session Manager to use encryption for signaling and media traffic."},"impact":0.7,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target Voice Video Session Management"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-7085r364679_chk","severity":"high","gid":"V-206830","rid":"SV-206830r508661_rule","stig_id":"SRG-NET-000168-VVSM-00016","gtitle":"SRG-NET-000168","fix_id":"F-7085r364680_fix","documentable":null,"legacy":["V-62095","SV-76585"],"cci":["CCI-000803"],"nist":["IA-7"]}},{"id":"SV-206831","code":"control 'SV-206831' do\n  title 'The Voice Video Session Manager must terminate all network connections associated with a communications session at the end of the session, or the session must be terminated after 15 minutes of inactivity.'\n  desc 'Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level, and de-allocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single, operating system level network connection.\n\nVoice Video Session Managers do not conduct media session; they conduct the session termination signaling.

Vendors are constantly updating and patching their products to address newly discovered security vulnerabilities. Organizations (including any contractor to the organization) are required to promptly install security-relevant software updates (e.g., patches, service packs, and hot fixes). Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system error handling must also be addressed expeditiously.\n\nOrganization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software may vary based on a variety of factors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw).\n\nThe current Voice Video STIG Guidance will be sunset because technology advancements and best practices have outpaced the existing guidelines.  DISA recognizes the current VOIP STIGs require updating and will be placing the VOIP guidance on the STIG sunset list until new VOIP guidance can be developed.  Plans are currently underway to draft new guidance, in the interim period, the sunset VOIP guidance can be utilized to the extent possible, but it will not be updated.","descriptions":{"default":"Security flaws with software applications are discovered daily.

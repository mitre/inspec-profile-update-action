RSVP-TE is also used to enable MPLS Fast Reroute, a network restoration mechanism that will reroute traffic onto a backup LSP in case of a node or link failure along the primary path. When there is a disruption in the MPLS core, such as a link flap or router reboot, the result is a significant amount of RSVP signaling, such as \"PathErr\" and \"ResvErr\" messages that need to be sent for every LSP using that link.\n\nWhen RSVP messages are sent out, they are sent either hop by hop or with the router alert bit set in the IP header. This means that every router along the path must examine the packet to determine if additional processing is required for these RSVP messages. If there is enough signaling traffic in the network, it is possible for an interface to receive more packets for its input queue than it can hold, resulting in dropped RSVP messages and hence slower RSVP convergence. Increasing the size of the interface input queue can help prevent dropping packets; however, there is still the risk of having a burst of signaling traffic that can fill the queue. Solutions to mitigate this risk are RSVP message pacing or refresh reduction to control the rate at which RSVP messages are sent.

The full-mesh configuration allows the PE router to maintain a single broadcast domain. With a full-mesh configuration, signaling and packet replication requirements for each provisioned virtual circuit on a PE can be high. To avoid the problem of a packet looping in the provider core, thereby adding more overhead, the PE devices must enforce a split-horizon principle for the emulated virtual circuits; that is, if a packet is received on an emulated virtual circuit, it is not forwarded on any other virtual circuit.","check":"Review the PE router configuration to verify that split horizon is enabled at each attachment circuit within each bridge domain as shown in the example below.\n\nbridge group L2GROUP\n  bridge-domain L2_BRIDGE_COI1\n   interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/2\n    split-horizon group\n   !\n\nIf split horizon is not enabled, this is a finding.\n\nNote: This requirement is only applicable to a mesh VPLS topology. VPLS solves the loop problem by using a split-horizon rule which states that member PE routers of a VPLS must forward VPLS traffic only to the local attachment circuits when they receive the traffic from the other PE routers. In a ring VPLS, split horizon must be disabled so that a PE router can forward a packet received from one pseudowire to another pseudowire. To prevent the consequential loop, at least one span in the ring would not have a pseudowire for any given VPLS instance.","fix":"Enable split horizon on all PE routers deploying VPLS in a full-mesh configuration.\n\nRP/0/0/CPU0:R3(config)#l2vpn\nRP/0/0/CPU0:R3(config-l2vpn)#bridge group L2GROUP\nRP/0/0/CPU0:R3(config-l2vpn-bg)#bridge-domain L2_BRIDGE_COI1\nRP/0/0/CPU0:R3(config-l2vpn-bg-bd)#interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/2\nRP/0/0/CPU0:R3(config-l2vpn-bg-bd-ac)#split-horizon group \nRP/0/0/CPU0:R3(config-l2vpn-bg-bd-ac)#end"},"impact":0.3,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target Cisco IOS XR Router RTR"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-18029r288768_chk","severity":"low","gid":"V-216797","rid":"SV-216797r531087_rule","stig_id":"CISC-RT-000690","gtitle":"SRG-NET-000512-RTR-000010","fix_id":"F-18027r288769_fix","documentable":null,"legacy":["SV-105939","V-96801"],"cci":["CCI-000366"],"nist":["CM-6 b"]}},{"id":"SV-216798","code":"control 'SV-216798' do\n  title 'The Cisco PE router providing Virtual Private LAN Services (VPLS) must be configured to have traffic storm control thresholds on CE-facing interfaces.'\n  desc 'A traffic storm occurs when packets flood a VPLS bridge, creating excessive traffic and degrading network performance.

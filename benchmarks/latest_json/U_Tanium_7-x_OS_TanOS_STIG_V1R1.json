One way to accomplish this is for the attacker to modify an existing account. Notification of account modification is one method for mitigating this risk. A comprehensive account management process will ensure an audit trail, which documents the modification of operating system user accounts and notifies the system administrator and ISSO of changes. Such a process greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be surreptitiously created and provides logging that can be used for forensic purposes.\n\nTo address access requirements, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level authentication/access/auditing mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements.","check":"1.

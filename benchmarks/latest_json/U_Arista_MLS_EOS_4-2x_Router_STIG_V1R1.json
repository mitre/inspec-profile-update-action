This diverted traffic could be analyzed to learn confidential information about the site's network or used to disrupt the network's ability to communicate with other networks. This is known as a \"traffic attraction attack\" and is prevented by configuring neighbor router authentication for routing updates.

It is imperative that end-to-end QoS is implemented within the IP core network to provide preferred treatment for mission-critical applications.","check":"Step 1: Verify the Arista router class-maps are configured to match on DSCP, protocols, or access control lists (ACLs) that identify traffic types based on ports.\n\nrouter#sh qos map\nqos map dscp 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 40 41 42 43 44 46 47 48 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 to traffic-class 0\nqos map dscp 11 to traffic-class 1\nqos map dscp 39 to traffic-class 2\nqos map dscp 15 49 to traffic-class 3\n!\n\nStep 2: Verify the Arista router policy-map is configured to set DSCP values for the defined class-maps in accordance with the QoS GIG Technical Profile.\n\nrouter#sh run |sec port-channel33\ninterface Port-Channel33\n   description L3-Routed-PO33->Distro1-QFX5200-32C-100G\n   routerport trunk allowed vlan 2100-2102,4033\n   routerport mode trunk\n   routerport trunk group 4033\n   qos trust dscp\n   !\n   tx-queue 0\n      bandwidth percent 20\n   !\n   tx-queue 1\n      bandwidth percent 40\n      shape rate 40088888\n   !\n   tx-queue 2\n      bandwidth percent 15\n      shape rate 15022222\n   !\n   tx-queue 3\n      bandwidth percent 25\n      shape rate 25250000\n!\n\nStep 3: Verify an output service policy is bound to all interfaces.\n\nrouter#sh run | section qos\ninterface Vlan33\n   service-policy type qos input policy3\nhardware tcam\n   profile QOS_TEST\n      feature acl port ip\n         sequence 45\n         key size limit 160\n         key field dscp dst-ip ip-frag ip-protocol l4-dst-port l4-ops l4-src-port src-ip tcp-control ttl\n         action count drop mirror\n         packet ipv4 forwarding bridged\n         packet ipv4 forwarding routed\n         packet ipv4 forwarding routed multicast\n         packet ipv4 mpls ipv4 forwarding mpls decap\n         packet ipv4 mpls ipv6 forwarding mpls decap\n         packet ipv4 non-vxlan forwarding routed decap\n         packet ipv4 vxlan eth ipv4 forwarding routed decap\n         packet ipv4 vxlan forwarding bridged decap\n      !\nfeature acl port ip egress mpls-tunnelled-match\n         sequence 100\n      !\n      feature acl port ipv6\n         sequence 25\n         key field dst-ipv6 ipv6-next-header ipv6-traffic-class l4-dst-port l4-ops-3b l4-src-port src-ipv6-high src-ipv6-low tcp-control\n         action count drop mirror\n         packet ipv6 forwarding bridged\n         packet ipv6 forwarding routed\n         packet ipv6 forwarding routed multicast\n         packet ipv6 ipv6 forwarding routed decap\n      !\n      feature acl port ipv6 egress\n         sequence 110\n         key field dst-ipv6 ipv6-next-header ipv6-traffic-class l4-dst-port l4-src-port src-ipv6-high src-ipv6-low tcp-control\n         action count drop\n         packet ipv6 forwarding bridged\n         packet ipv6 forwarding routed\n      !\n      feature acl port mac\n         sequence 55\n         key size limit 160\n         key field dst-mac ether-type src-mac\n         action count drop mirror\n         packet ipv4 forwarding bridged\n         packet ipv4 forwarding routed\n         packet ipv4 forwarding routed multicast\n         packet ipv4 mpls ipv4 forwarding mpls decap\n         packet ipv4 mpls ipv6 forwarding mpls decap\n         packet ipv4 non-vxlan forwarding routed decap\n         packet ipv4 vxlan forwarding bridged decap\n         packet ipv6 forwarding bridged\n         packet ipv6 forwarding routed\n         packet ipv6 forwarding routed decap\n         packet ipv6 forwarding routed multicast\n         packet ipv6 ipv6 forwarding routed decap\n         packet mpls forwarding bridged decap\n         packet mpls ipv4 forwarding mpls\n         packet mpls ipv6 forwarding mpls\n         packet mpls non-ip forwarding mpls\n         packet non-ip forwarding bridged\n      !\n\nStep 4: Verify the Arista router is configured for a minimum of four queues, 0 through 3, for (Port-Channel33) as round robin, with voice strict-priority.

The VC ID specifies a pseudowire associated with an ingress and egress PE router and the customer-facing attachment circuits.\n\nTo guarantee that all frames are forwarded onto the correct pseudowire and to the correct customer and attachment circuits, it is imperative that the correct VC ID is configured for each attachment circuit.","check":"Review the ingress and egress PE router configuration for each virtual circuit that has been provisioned.\n\nVerify the correct and unique VCID has been configured for the appropriate attachment circuit.\n\nRun the command sh run | section patch\npatch panel\n   patch port\n      connector 1 interface Ethernet2\n      connector 2 pseudowire bgp vpws evi-1 pseudowire pw1\n   patch subintf\n      connector 1 interface Ethernet3.1\n      connector 2 pseudowire bgp vpws evi-1 pseudowire pw2\n\nRun the command sh run | section router bgp          \nrouter bgp 65000\n   neighbor 10.0.0.1 remote-as 1\n   neighbor 10.0.0.1 send-community extended\n   neighbor 10.0.0.1 maximum-routes 12000\n   !\n   vpws evi-1\n      rd 10.2.2.2:2\n      route-target import export evpn 0.0.0.0:1\n      mpls control-word\n      !\n      pseudowire pw1\n         evpn vpws id local 2001 remote 1001\n      !\n      pseudowire pw2\n         evpn vpws id local 2002 remote 1002\n   !\n   address-family evpn\n      neighbor default encapsulation mpls next-hop-self source-interface Loopback0\n      neighbor 10.0.0.1 activate\n\nIf the correct VC ID has not been configured on both routers, this is a finding.","fix":"Assign globally unique VC IDs for each virtual circuit and configure the attachment circuits with the appropriate VC ID.\n\nConfigure the same VC ID on both ends of the VC.\n\npatch panel\n   patch port\n      connector 1 interface Ethernet2\n      connector 2 pseudowire bgp vpws evi-1 pseudowire pw1\n   patch subintf\n      connector 1 interface Ethernet3.1\n      connector 2 pseudowire bgp vpws evi-1 pseudowire pw2\n          \nrouter bgp 65000\n   neighbor 10.0.0.1 remote-as 1\n   neighbor 10.0.0.1 send-community extended\n   neighbor 10.0.0.1 maximum-routes 12000\n   !\n   vpws evi-1\n      rd 10.2.2.2:2\n      route-target import export evpn 0.0.0.0:1\n      mpls control-word\n      !\n      pseudowire pw1\n         evpn vpws id local 2001 remote 1001\n      !\n      pseudowire pw2\n         evpn vpws id local 2002 remote 1002\n   !\n   address-family evpn\n      neighbor default encapsulation mpls next-hop-self source-interface Loopback0\n      neighbor 10.0.0.1 activate\n                    \nVLAN mode example:\n\ninterface Ethernet3\n   no routerport\n!   \ninterface Ethernet3.1\n   encapsulation dot1q vlan 1\n      \nFlexible Encapsulation example:\n\ninterface Ethernet3\n   no routerport\n!   \ninterface Ethernet3.1\n   encapsulation vlan\n      client dot1q 11 network client"},"impact":0.7,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target Arista MLS EOS 4.2x RTR"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-59731r882505_chk","severity":"high","gid":"V-256055","rid":"SV-256055r882507_rule","stig_id":"ARST-RT-000760","gtitle":"SRG-NET-000512-RTR-000008","fix_id":"F-59674r882506_fix","documentable":null,"cci":["CCI-000366"],"nist":["CM-6 b"]}},{"id":"SV-256056","code":"control 'SV-256056' do\n  title 'The Arista Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) router must be configured to use its loopback address as the source address when originating MSDP traffic.'\n  desc \"Using a loopback address as the source address offers a multitude of uses for security, access, management, and scalability of MSDP routers.

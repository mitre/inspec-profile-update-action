Confirm the design requires secure communication from the email system to the MEM. Verify the MEM, NOC, and CMDs are approved for use in DoD. If the email domain employs the required architecture and is documented in the EDSP, this is not a finding.\n\nIf the architecture uses the EAS protocol to Commercial Mobile Devices (CMD) without connecting through external secure NOCs and encapsulating in a secure tunnel from the management servers residing in the DoD to the NOC and from the NOC to the CMD, this is a finding.  If the use of EAS is not documented in the EDSP, this is a finding.","fix":"Email client services to Commercial Mobile Devices, including the required components of the architecture, must be documented in the Email Domain Security Plan (EDSP)."},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target E-mail Services Policy"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-46505r2_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-39139","rid":"SV-50955r4_rule","stig_id":"EMG3-055 EMail","gtitle":"EMG3-055 EMail Security for CMD","fix_id":"F-44116r1_fix","documentable":null,"responsibility":"Other","ia_controls":"DCFA-1"}}],"groups":[{"id":"controls/SV-20630.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-20630"]},{"id":"controls/SV-20644.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-20644"]},{"id":"controls/SV-20646.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-20646"]},{"id":"controls/SV-20650.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-20650"]},{"id":"controls/SV-20652.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-20652"]},{"id":"controls/SV-20654.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-20654"]},{"id":"controls/SV-20667.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-20667"]},{"id":"controls/SV-20669.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-20669"]},{"id":"controls/SV-20671.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-20671"]},{"id":"controls/SV-20673.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-20673"]},{"id":"controls/SV-20675.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-20675"]},{"id":"controls/SV-20677.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-20677"]},{"id":"controls/SV-20679.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-20679"]},{"id":"controls/SV-20681.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-20681"]},{"id":"controls/SV-20683.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-20683"]},{"id":"controls/SV-20685.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-20685"]},{"id":"controls/SV-21609.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-21609"]},{"id":"controls/SV-21613.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-21613"]},{"id":"controls/SV-43808.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-43808"]},{"id":"controls/SV-46514.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-46514"]},{"id":"controls/SV-50955.rb","title":null,"controls":["SV-50955"]}],"name":"Exchange_2010_-_Policy","title":null,"maintainer":null,"copyright":null,"copyright_email":null,"license":null,"summary":null,"description":null,"version":"1.0.0","supports":[],"depends":[],"inspec_version":null,"inputs":[],"sha256":"082f28704df6bc0b73f172eabaefa36e52ad08c52a56f2d365e930a5e8109f86","status_message":"","status":"loaded","generator":{"name":"inspec","version":"6.6.0"}}

The Tanium environment can perform hundreds or thousands of times faster than other security or systems management tools because the Tanium Clients communicate in secure, linearly-controlled peer-to-peer rings. Because clients dynamically communicate with other nearby agents based on proximity and latency, rings tend to form automatically to match a customer's topology--endpoints in California will form one ring while endpoints in Germany will form a separate ring.\n\nhttps://docs.tanium.com/platform_install/platform_install/reference_network_ports.html","check":"Note: This check is performed for the Tanium Endpoints and must be validated against the HBSS desktop firewall policy applied to the Endpoints.\n\nConsult with the HBSS administration for assistance.\n\nValidate a rule exists within the HBSS HIPS firewall policies for managed clients for the following:\n\nPort Needed: Tanium Clients or Zone Clients over TCP port 17472, bi-directionally.\n\nIf a host-based firewall rule does not exist to allow TCP port 17472, bi-directionally, this is a finding.\n\nConsult with the network firewall administrator and validate rules exist for the following:\n\nAllow TCP traffic on port 17472 from any computer to be managed on a local area network to any other computer to be managed on the same local area network.\n\nIf a network firewall rule does not exist to allow TCP port 17472 from any managed computer to any other managed computer on the same local area network, this is a finding.","fix":"Configure host-based and network firewall rules as required."},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target Tanium 7.0"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-78153r1_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-78583","rid":"SV-93289r1_rule","stig_id":"TANS-CL-000004","gtitle":"SRG-APP-000142","fix_id":"F-85319r1_fix","documentable":null,"cci":["CCI-000382"],"nist":["CM-7 b"]}},{"id":"SV-93291","code":"control 'SV-93291' do\n  title 'Control of the Tanium Client service must be restricted to SYSTEM access only for all managed clients.'\n  desc \"The reliability of the Tanium client's ability to operate depends upon controlling access to the Tanium client service.

Without authenticating devices, unidentified or unknown devices may be introduced, thereby facilitating malicious activity. Bidirectional authentication provides stronger safeguards to validate the identity of other devices for connections that are of greater risk.\n\nThis requirement applies only to applications that are either distributed or can allow access to data non-locally. Use of this requirement will be limited to situations where the data owner has a strict requirement for ensuring data integrity and confidentiality is maintained at every step of the data transfer and handling process. When transmitting data, applications need to leverage transmission protection mechanisms, such as TLS, SSL VPNs, or IPsec.\n\nCommunication paths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification. Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical distribution systems) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques). If physical means of protection are employed, logical means (cryptography) do not have to be employed, and vice versa.\n\nAll of Tanium's signing capabilities should be enabled upon install. Tanium supports the cryptographic signing and verification before execution of all Sensors, Questions, Actions, Sensor Libraries, File Shards, etc. Enabling signing does away with the ability of an attacker to conduct man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks for the purposes of remote code execution and precludes the modification of the aforementioned data elements in transit. Additionally, Tanium supports object-level signing for content ingested into the Tanium platform. This allows for the detection and rejection of changes to objects (sensors, actions, etc.) by even a privileged user within Tanium.\n\nTanium has built-in signing capabilities enabled by default when installed. Cryptographic signing and verification of all Sensors, Questions, Actions, Sensor Libraries, File Shards, etc. before execution will be enforced by Tanium.\n\nAuthenticity protection provides protection against man-in-the-middle attacks/session hijacking and the insertion of false information into sessions.\n\nApplication communication sessions are protected using transport encryption protocols, such as SSL or TLS. SSL/TLS provides web applications with a way to authenticate user sessions and encrypt application traffic. Session authentication can be single (one-way) or mutual (two-way) in nature. Single authentication authenticates the server for the client, whereas mutual authentication provides a means for both the client and the server to authenticate each other.\n\nThis requirement applies to applications that use communications sessions. This includes but is not limited to web-based applications and Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA).\n\nThis requirement addresses communications protection at the application session, versus the network packet, and establishes grounds for confidence at both ends of communications sessions in ongoing identities of other parties and in the validity of information transmitted.

Vendors are constantly updating and patching their products to address newly discovered security vulnerabilities. Organizations (including any contractor to the organization) are required to promptly install security-relevant software updates (e.g., patches, service packs, and hot fixes). Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system error handling must also be addressed expeditiously.\n\nOrganization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software may vary based on a variety of factors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw).\n\nThis requirement will apply to software patch management solutions that are used to install patches across the enclave and also to applications themselves that are not part of that patch management solution. For example, many browsers today provide the capability to install their own patch software. Patch criticality, as well as system criticality will vary. Therefore, the tactical situations regarding the patch management process will also vary. This means that the time period used must be a configurable parameter. Time frames for application of security-relevant software updates may be dependent upon the Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process.\n\nThe application will be configured to check for and install security-relevant software updates within an identified time period from the availability of the update.

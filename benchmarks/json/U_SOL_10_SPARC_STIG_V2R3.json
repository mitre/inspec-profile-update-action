Common attack vectors such as malicious association and ad hoc networks will allow an attacker to spoof a wireless access point (AP), allowing validated systems to connect to the malicious AP and enabling the attacker to monitor and record network traffic. These malicious APs can also serve to create a man-in-the-middle attack or be used to create a denial of service to valid network resources.","check":"This is N/A for systems that do not have wireless network adapters.\n\nVerify that there are no wireless interfaces configured on the system:\n\n# ifconfig -a\n\n\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr b8:ac:6f:65:31:e5  \n          inet addr:192.168.2.100  Bcast:192.168.2.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          inet6 addr: fe80::baac:6fff:fe65:31e5/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:2697529 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:2630541 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:2159382827 (2.0 GiB)  TX bytes:1389552776 (1.2 GiB)\n          Interrupt:17 \n\nlo        Link encap:Local Loopback  \n          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:16436  Metric:1\n          RX packets:2849 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:2849 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n          RX bytes:2778290 (2.6 MiB)  TX bytes:2778290 (2.6 MiB)\n\n\nIf a wireless interface is configured, it must be documented and approved by the local Authorizing Official.\n\nIf a wireless interface is configured and has not been documented and approved, this is a finding.","fix":"Configure the system to disable all wireless network interfaces."},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target Solaris 10 SPARC"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-36368r602707_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-220066","rid":"SV-220066r854396_rule","stig_id":"GEN007841","gtitle":"SRG-OS-000300","fix_id":"F-36332r602708_fix","documentable":null,"legacy":["SV-87413","V-72771"],"cci":["CCI-001443","CCI-001444","CCI-002418"],"nist":["AC-18 (1)","AC-18 (1)","SC-8"]}},{"id":"SV-220067","code":"control 'SV-220067' do\n  title 'The system must use an appropriate reverse-path filter for IPv6 network traffic, if the system uses IPv6.'\n  desc 'Reverse-path filtering provides protection against spoofed source addresses by causing the system to discard packets with source addresses for which the system has no route or if the route does not point towards the interface on which the packet arrived.

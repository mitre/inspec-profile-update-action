This permits a workstation user to view the conference in near real time but not to participate in it. VTUs may also stream other content such as pre-recorded media played from a VCR or similar media source and some VTUs support streaming while others do not. It seems that as vendors mature their streaming server technology and more products become available, they are removing the streaming capability from the CODEC where it presents greater vulnerability. \n     \nStreaming from a VTU’s CODEC can also be used to record a conference by sending the stream to a recording/streaming server that can perform the recording function. These servers also serve as streaming distribution points. Recording/Streaming servers are discussed later. \n     \nWhile streaming from a CODEC most often uses IP multicast, streams can also be sent to one receiver (e.g., PC or recording/distribution server), or to multiple receivers in the local broadcast domain \n     \nIP multicast or broadcast streaming works best within a LAN where ample bandwidth is available and IP multicast is supported.  While multicast streaming is conceivable across a WAN such as the Internet, it is much less feasible and less reliable due to limited multicast support and access circuit bandwidth constraints. To use IP multicast, the network elements must be configured to support it.\n     \nTo enable streaming, the following configuration items are needed:\n     \n- Destination address, unicast (address of specific destination, client or server), broadcast (local subnet or global), multicast (address configured on a router in the range 224.0.0.1-239.255.255.255)\n- IP port(s) (some CODECs may require one port for audio and one for video)\n- Time-To-Live (TTL) (i.e., number of router hops or routers to traverse) \n     \nVTU Streaming can typically be activated by a user selecting it from a menu. It could also be possible to activate it by the simple press of a button on the remote control. As such, it could be possible to activate streaming by accident when it is not desired or required. Additionally, some VTUs permit a remote user to activate the feature. \n     \nThe “broadcast” or stream is received by a compatible client running on a PC. Examples of clients used are RealMedia Player™, Apple Quicktime™, VIC, or Cisco IP/TV. \n     \nTo receive a multicast stream, the recipient can do one of the following two things:\n     \n- First, they can use a web browser to access the IP address of the CODEC that is streaming. The user accesses the CODEC’s web page and clicks a link to receive the stream. This causes the browser to download an .sdp file (e.g., filename.sdp) that contains information about the stream and launch the streaming client. The .sdp file tells the client what IP address and port the stream can be found on as well as the compression types (protocols) being used. Accessing the streaming web page or .sdp file typically requires the use of a password before gaining access. Some vendors use the administrator password (not acceptable) while others use a “meeting password” In some cases the recipient (remote user) can also activate streaming (i.e., cause the CODEC to begin streaming) from this web page if it is not already activated. \n- The second method of access is essentially direct. The recipient uses the streaming client to retrieve the .sdp file from the CODECs IP address. Some streaming clients can access a multicast stream without the use of an .sdp file.\n     \nThe only access control for streaming is that imposed by the CODEC for accessing its web page and/or retrieving the .sdp file. While this is effective using clients such as RealMedia Player™, Apple Quicktime™, which require the .sdp file information to function, there are other clients that do not. Using a client that does not, once the CODEC is streaming, anyone knowing the IP address and port for the stream can view the stream. There is no access control for viewing a media stream in this manner because IP provides no access control for joining an IP multicast group.\n     \nWhen streaming, there is no way of knowing who or how many recipients are viewing a conference. The number of possible recipients is virtually unlimited. Typically, there is only an indication on the VTU screen that the CODEC is streaming. Again, some VTUs permit streaming to be activated remotely by anybody who knows the IP address of the VTU and can access its streaming web page. As such, it could be possible for an unauthorized person to activate streaming and eavesdrop on the room or a conference in session. These vulnerabilities can greatly jeopardize the confidentiality of any given conference by broadcasting it on the connected LAN to indeterminate numbers of unknown recipients. \n     \nAn additional vulnerability that streaming presents to any conference, whether hosted on a central MCU, point-to-point, or a MCU integrated unto a VTU is that any meeting participant could accidentally or maliciously stream the meeting from their VTU if their VTU supports streaming. For these reasons, the activation and use of streaming from a VTU/CODEC is discouraged and must be tightly controlled by all IAOs who are responsible for any streaming capable VTU that might participate in a conference. CODECs must be configured in such a way that if streaming is activated, the stream can only be accessed by authorized individuals or be non-functional or inaccessible if activated by accident.\n     \nGenerally speaking, the use of streaming to an IP multicast or broadcast address should never be used or activated unless it is required to fulfill a specific, validated, authorized, and documented mission requirement. This applies to both streaming from a CODEC or a recording/streaming server because of the inherent lack of full user/recipient access control. Streaming to a unicast address, i.e., one recipient, from a CODEC should be the only method used. The one recipient should only be a recording/streaming server. The best method for streaming to a number of recipients is to use a recording/streaming/web server where media can be encrypted and DoD compliant access control and auditing can be enforced via individual (unicast) viewer sessions with the server.

This permits a workstation user to view the conference in near real time but not to participate in it. VTUs may also stream other content such as pre-recorded media played from a VCR or similar media source and some VTUs support streaming while others do not. It seems that as vendors mature their streaming server technology and more products become available, they are removing the streaming capability from the CODEC where it presents greater vulnerability. \n     \nStreaming from a VTU’s CODEC can also be used to record a conference by sending the stream to a recording/streaming server that can perform the recording function. These servers also serve as streaming distribution points. Recording/Streaming servers are discussed later. \n     \nWhile streaming from a CODEC most often uses IP multicast, streams can also be sent to one receiver (e.g., PC or recording/distribution server), or to multiple receivers in the local broadcast domain \n     \nIP multicast or broadcast streaming works best within a LAN where ample bandwidth is available and IP multicast is supported.  While multicast streaming is conceivable across a WAN such as the Internet, it is much less feasible and less reliable due to limited multicast support and access circuit bandwidth constraints. To use IP multicast, the network elements must be configured to support it.\n     \nTo enable streaming, the following configuration items are needed:\n     \n- Destination address, unicast (address of specific destination, client or server), broadcast (local subnet or global), multicast (address configured on a router in the range 224.0.0.1-239.255.255.255)\n- IP port(s) (some CODECs may require one port for audio and one for video)\n- Time-To-Live (TTL) (i.e., number of router hops or routers to traverse) \n     \nVTU Streaming can typically be activated by a user selecting it from a menu. It could also be possible to activate it by the simple press of a button on the remote control. As such, it could be possible to activate streaming by accident when it is not desired or required. Additionally, some VTUs permit a remote user to activate the feature. \n     \nThe “broadcast” or stream is received by a compatible client running on a PC. Examples of clients used are RealMedia Player™, Apple Quicktime™, VIC, or Cisco IP/TV. \n     \nTo receive a multicast stream, the recipient can do one of the following two things:\n     \n- First, they can use a web browser to access the IP address of the CODEC that is streaming. The user accesses the CODEC’s web page and clicks a link to receive the stream. This causes the browser to download an .sdp file (e.g., filename.sdp) that contains information about the stream and launch the streaming client. The .sdp file tells the client what IP address and port the stream can be found on as well as the compression types (protocols) being used. Accessing the streaming web page or .sdp file typically requires the use of a password before gaining access. Some vendors use the administrator password (not acceptable) while others use a “meeting password” In some cases the recipient (remote user) can also activate streaming (i.e., cause the CODEC to begin streaming) from this web page if it is not already activated. \n- The second method of access is essentially direct. The recipient uses the streaming client to retrieve the .sdp file from the CODECs IP address. Some streaming clients can access a multicast stream without the use of an .sdp file.\n     \nThe only access control for streaming is that imposed by the CODEC for accessing its web page and/or retrieving the .sdp file. While this is effective using clients such as RealMedia Player™, Apple Quicktime™, which require the .sdp file information to function, there are other clients that do not. Using a client that does not, once the CODEC is streaming, anyone knowing the IP address and port for the stream can view the stream. There is no access control for viewing a media stream in this manner because IP provides no access control for joining an IP multicast group.\n     \nWhen streaming, there is no way of knowing who or how many recipients are viewing a conference. The number of possible recipients is virtually unlimited. Typically, there is only an indication on the VTU screen that the CODEC is streaming. Again, some VTUs permit streaming to be activated remotely by anybody who knows the IP address of the VTU and can access its streaming web page. As such, it could be possible for an unauthorized person to activate streaming and eavesdrop on the room or a conference in session. These vulnerabilities can greatly jeopardize the confidentiality of any given conference by broadcasting it on the connected LAN to indeterminate numbers of unknown recipients. \n     \nAn additional vulnerability that streaming presents to any conference, whether hosted on a central MCU, point-to-point, or a MCU integrated unto a VTU is that any meeting participant could accidentally or maliciously stream the meeting from their VTU if their VTU supports streaming. For these reasons, the activation and use of streaming from a VTU/CODEC is discouraged and must be tightly controlled by all IAOs who are responsible for any streaming capable VTU that might participate in a conference. CODECs must be configured in such a way that if streaming is activated, the stream can only be accessed by authorized individuals or be non-functional or inaccessible if activated by accident.\n     \nGenerally speaking, the use of streaming to an IP multicast or broadcast address should never be used or activated unless it is required to fulfill a specific, validated, authorized, and documented mission requirement. This applies to both streaming from a CODEC or a recording/streaming server because of the inherent lack of full user/recipient access control. Streaming to a unicast address, i.e., one recipient, from a CODEC should be the only method used. The one recipient should only be a recording/streaming server. The best method for streaming to a number of recipients is to use a recording/streaming/web server where media can be encrypted and DoD compliant access control and auditing can be enforced via individual (unicast) viewer sessions with the server.

One of these measures is to set a one-time-use password for the streamed media. Another measure is to install configuration settings to limit the reach of the streamed media across the network to only those portions that are to receive it. This is done by setting the TTL as low as possible.

If multicast is used, these are different from the default settings used by the vendor, and are randomly different each time they are used. \n- Set TTL/router hops to an appropriate number to limit the range of distribution of the media stream to within the local LAN or Intranet as required.

Typically, this involves connecting a PC workstation, on which the presentation is displayed and controlled, to a CODEC which distributes the presentation to the conferees. Care in operating this feature must be exercised so that the PC user does not inadvertently display information on their workstation that is not part of the conference and is not intended to be viewed by the conferees. Users must be aware that anything that they display on their PC workstation display while connected to the CODEC will be displayed on all of the conference monitors. This collaboration/display feature could result in the disclosure of sensitive or classified information to individuals that do not have a validated need-to-know or have the proper clearance to view the information. This is a problem when sharing a PC desktop via any collaboration tool using any connection method.\n\nThe first of the PC-CODEC interconnection methods, supported by most (but not all) CODECs, is the direct connection of the PC video output to an external video input on the CODEC. This method is most common interconnection method, is most secure, and is the recommended method for DoD. This is the only method available to users of VTUs connected to ISDN only (i.e., not connected to an IP network in addition to the ISDN lines).The second method for PC-CODEC interconnection for data/presentation sharing is to establish a virtual connection between the CODEC and PC workstation across an IP based LAN. While this method is implemented in different ways by different vendors, most if not all methods require the installation of an application or a utility on the PC workstation that is to share its data or display. While this method is convenient, since it does not require a cable connected to the CODEC, it presents varying degrees of vulnerability to the PC and the data it contains depending upon the particular application or utility installed. Additionally, the installation of such software is contrary to most DoD policy regarding approved workstation applications. All such software must be thoroughly evaluated and approved before installation.\n\nMost vendors provide a proprietary application or utility that is loaded on the PC workstation to establish the virtual connection between the PC and CODEC. The main purpose and capability of this utility is to capture the PC’s display graphics and send it to the CODEC. Typically, these utilities require only the IP address of the CODEC. The CODEC may or may not require a password to accept this input. When reading the documentation on these utilities there is no indication that the media stream generated by these utilities is encrypted. This may or may not be an issue depending upon the protocols used by the utility. Sniffing the stream may or may not reveal the displayed information. One vendor provides a utility to upload MS PowerPoint files to the CODEC and display them using an embedded viewer. This same vendor provides another utility to integrate with MS NetMeeting on the PC and stream content from there using T.120 protocol. \n\nAn additional feature of some of these utilities is the capability of conferees to share and work on files across the connection between CODECs. This feature brings a larger set of collaboration tool features to the VTC arena. \n\nAt least one vendor’s virtual connection method requires the installation of PC remote control desktop sharing software on the PC. Once the remote control/access server application is running, anybody with the matching or compatible viewer/control application and the access password can connect to the PC workstation from another PC workstation. This provides full control of its resources and access to all of its files since this is the purpose of this type of application. This type of application can receive remote keyboard and mouse inputs as if the user was sitting at the PC itself controlling it. As such this method is capable of much more than capturing the graphics displayed on the PC monitor and sending it to a CODEC. As such an adversary could gain full control of the PC workstation at any time when the server application is running, whether there is a conference being displayed or not. Many such server applications are started as a service when the workstation is booted. This means that the connection is available to an adversary any time the PC is running. This is a huge vulnerability for the PC workstation. \nAs such, the use of virtual connection methods must first be approved by the DAA and must be tightly controlled. \n\nAnother issue that must be addressed is the access control between the VTU and the PC. This discussion and/or requirements are dependent upon the direction of the access. (i.e., PC to VTU or VTU to PC) Access to a PC (from a VTU), by policy, requires a strong policy compliant password (and other measures, supported or not). Such a password cannot be entered from a VTU remote control unless an on screen keyboard (or cell phone text entry requiring password display) is used thus opening the password to shoulder surfing or being viewed by a conference room full of people (discussed earlier). If the VTU is to initiate the connection to the PC, it is best to store a strong password on the VTU that will identify the VTU to the PC sharing application. The sharing application is only run when needed when the PC is required to interface with the VTU; it is not run as a service that is constantly available. Other constraints could apply. The recommended alternative is to initiate all VTU - PC connections from the PC and implementing the appropriate access control in the VTU in compliance with password policy if a virtual connection is to be used. Better yet, use a direct connection using a video out connection on the PC.  \n\nFurthermore, it is recommended that, if the remote control/access method is used, a PC workstation be dedicated to the purpose of displaying presentations on the CODEC. No other information should be placed on this PC. The PC should be turned off or disconnected from the LAN when a presentation is not being displayed to a conference.

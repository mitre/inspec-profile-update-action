In addition, access to audit records provides information an attacker could use to his or her advantage.\n\nTo ensure the veracity of audit data, the information system and/or the network device must protect audit information from any and all unauthorized read access.\n\nThis requirement can be achieved through multiple methods which will depend upon system architecture and design. Commonly employed methods for protecting audit information include least privilege permissions as well as restricting the location and number of log file repositories.\n\nAdditionally, network devices with user interfaces to audit records should not allow for the unfettered manipulation of or access to those records via the device interface. If the device provides access to the audit data, the device becomes accountable for ensuring audit information is protected from unauthorized access.","check":"Login page >> Enter non admin user id and password, select Default for domain >> Click Login.

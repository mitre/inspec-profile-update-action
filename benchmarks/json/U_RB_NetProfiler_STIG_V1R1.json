For each network device, known and potential DOS attacks must be identified and solutions for each type implemented. A variety of technologies exist to limit or, in some cases, eliminate the effects of DOS attacks (e.g., limiting processes or restricting the number of sessions the device opens at one time). Employing increased capacity and bandwidth, combined with service redundancy, may reduce the susceptibility to some DOS attacks.\n\nThe security safeguards cannot be defined at the DOD level because they vary according to the capabilities of the individual network devices and the security controls applied on the adjacent networks (for example, firewalls performing packet filtering to block DOS attacks).","check":"Go to configuration >> Appliance Security >> Password Security. \n\nUnder Access >> Remote Access, verify the \"Restrict Web access to\" radio button and the \"Restrict SSH access to\" radio button are selected, and the boxes contain the authorized range of IP addresses. \n\nIf this is not set, this is a finding.","fix":"Go to configuration >> Appliance Security >> Password Security. \n\nUnder Access >> Remote Access, select the \"Restrict Web access to\" radio button and the \"Restrict SSH access to\" radio button, and fill the corresponding boxes with the authorized range of IP addresses."},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target Riverbed NetProfiler"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-59765r882779_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-256091","rid":"SV-256091r882781_rule","stig_id":"RINP-DM-000055","gtitle":"SRG-APP-000435-NDM-000315","fix_id":"F-59708r882780_fix","documentable":null,"cci":["CCI-002385"],"nist":["SC-5 a"]}},{"id":"SV-256092","code":"control 'SV-256092' do\n  title 'The Riverbed NetProfiler must be configured to use redundant Syslog servers that are configured on a different system than the NetProfiler appliance.'\n  desc 'Information stored in one location is vulnerable to accidental or incidental deletion or alteration.\n\nOffloading is a common process in information systems with limited audit storage capacity.'\n  desc 'check', 'Go to Administration >> General Settings. \n\nUnder \"Syslog\", verify the entries for Server 1 Host and Server 2 Host are configured. \n\nVerify \"Audit Trail\" and \"Events\" are selected for each Syslog server. \n\nIf this is not true, this is a finding.'\n  desc 'fix', 'Go to Administration >> General Settings. \n\nConfigure the entry for Server 1 Host. \n\nConfigure the entry for Server 2 Host. \n\nCheck \"Audit Trail\" and \"Events\" for each configured server.'\n  impact 0.5\n  ref 'DPMS Target Riverbed NetProfiler'\n  tag check_id: 'C-59766r882782_chk'\n  tag severity: 'medium'\n  tag gid: 'V-256092'\n  tag rid: 'SV-256092r882784_rule'\n  tag stig_id: 'RINP-DM-000057'\n  tag gtitle: 'SRG-APP-000515-NDM-000325'\n  tag fix_id: 'F-59709r882783_fix'\n  tag 'documentable'\n  tag cci: ['CCI-001851']\n  tag nist: ['AU-4 (1)']\nend","source_location":{"line":1,"ref":"U_RB_NetProfiler_STIG_V1R1/controls/SV-256092.rb"},"title":"The Riverbed NetProfiler must be configured to use redundant Syslog servers that are configured on a different system than the NetProfiler appliance.","desc":"Information stored in one location is vulnerable to accidental or incidental deletion or alteration.\n\nOffloading is a common process in information systems with limited audit storage capacity.","descriptions":{"default":"Information stored in one location is vulnerable to accidental or incidental deletion or alteration.\n\nOffloading is a common process in information systems with limited audit storage capacity.","check":"Go to Administration >> General Settings. \n\nUnder \"Syslog\", verify the entries for Server 1 Host and Server 2 Host are configured. \n\nVerify \"Audit Trail\" and \"Events\" are selected for each Syslog server. \n\nIf this is not true, this is a finding.","fix":"Go to Administration >> General Settings. \n\nConfigure the entry for Server 1 Host. \n\nConfigure the entry for Server 2 Host. \n\nCheck \"Audit Trail\" and \"Events\" for each configured server."},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target Riverbed NetProfiler"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-59766r882782_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-256092","rid":"SV-256092r882784_rule","stig_id":"RINP-DM-000057","gtitle":"SRG-APP-000515-NDM-000325","fix_id":"F-59709r882783_fix","documentable":null,"cci":["CCI-001851"],"nist":["AU-4 (1)"]}},{"id":"SV-256093","code":"control 'SV-256093' do\n  title 'The Riverbed NetProfiler must be configured to use an authentication server to authenticate users prior to granting administrative access.'\n  desc \"Centralized management of authentication settings increases the security of remote and nonlocal access methods.

It is imperative that end-to-end QoS is implemented within the IP core network to provide preferred treatment for mission-critical applications.","check":"Review the router configuration and verify that a QoS policy has been configured to provide preferred treatment for mission-critical applications in accordance with the QoS GIG Technical Profile. \n\nVerify that the classifiers are configured to match on DSCP.\nNote: Juniper routers also support classifying on MPLS EXP and IEEE 802.1 values. \n\nVerify that the schedulers are configured to set DSCP values for the defined classifiers in accordance with the QoS GIG Technical Profile. \n\nVerify that classifiers are applied all interfaces. \n\nNote: The GTP QOS document (GTP-0009) can be downloaded via the following link:\nhttps://intellipedia.intelink.gov/wiki/Portal:GIG_Technical_Guidance/GTG_GTPs/GTP_Development_List\n\nTo classify on L4 ports or protocols, use stateless firewall filters to direct matched traffic into the required forwarding class.\n\n[edit class-of-service]\nclassifiers {\n    dscp <classifier name> {\n        forwarding-class NC {\n            loss-priority low code-points 110000;\n        }\n        forwarding-class EF {\n            loss-priority high code-points [ 101101 101111 100101 100111 110011 ];\n            loss-priority low code-points [ 101000 100000 101001 101011 100001 100011 110001 ];\n        }\n        forwarding-class AF41 {\n            loss-priority high code-points [ 100010 100100 100110 ];\n            loss-priority low code-points [ 011000 101110 011100 011110 ];\n        }\n        forwarding-class AF31 {\n            loss-priority high code-points [ 011101 011111 011010 010101 010111 010010 001101 001010 010000 ];\n            loss-priority low code-points [ 001001 001011 010001 010011 011001 011011 ];\n        }\n        forwarding-class BE {\n            loss-priority high code-points 000000;\n        }\n        forwarding-class Default {\n            loss-priority high code-points 001000;\n        }\n        forwarding-class dscp15 {\n            loss-priority high code-points 001111;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nNote: Some platforms apply DSCP values to both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic with a single classifier definition (as shown).

For example:\n[edit interfaces]\n<internal interface name> {\n    unit <number> {\n        family inet {\n            filter {\n                input internal-inbound-ipv4;\n            }                           \n            address <IPv4 address>/<mask>;       \n        }                               \n        family inet6 {                  \n            filter {                    \n                input internal-inbound-ipv6;\n            }                           \n            address <IPv6 address>/<prefix>;     \n        }                               \n    }                                   \n}\n\nNote: Some Juniper devices support both monolithic filters and filter lists. Filter lists separate each term, or set of terms, into a separate filter that is applied sequentially to an interface. If using filter lists, the keywords \"input\" or \"output\" change to \"input-list\" or \"output-list\". Verify the final list item is a deny-all filter. The deny-all filter is created once per family and can be reused across multiple lists. For example:\n\ninput-list [ permit_mgt permit_routing_protocols default-deny ];\n\nIf uRPF or an egress filter to restrict the router from accepting outbound IP packets that contain an illegitimate address in the source address field has not been configured on all internal interfaces, this is a finding.","fix":"This requirement is not applicable for the DODIN Backbone.\n\nConfigure the router to ensure that an egress filter or uRPF is configured to restrict the router from accepting any outbound IP packet that contains an external IP address in the source field.\n\nset interfaces <internal interface name> unit <number> family inet rpf-check\nset interfaces <internal interface name> unit <number> family inet6 rpf-check\n\nFor example, configure firewall filter and apply to internal interfaces:\nset policy-options prefix-list internal-prefixes-ipv4 192.0.2.0/24\nset policy-options prefix-list internal-prefixes-ipv6 2001:0:2::/64\n\nset firewall family inet filter internal-inbound-ipv4 term 1 from source-prefix-list internal-prefixes-ipv4\nset firewall family inet filter internal-inbound-ipv4 term 1 then accept\nset firewall family inet filter internal-inbound-ipv4 term default then log\nset firewall family inet filter internal-inbound-ipv4 term default then syslog\nset firewall family inet filter internal-inbound-ipv4 term default then discard\nset firewall family inet6 filter internal-inbound-ipv6 term 1 from source-prefix-list internal-prefixes-ipv6\nset firewall family inet6 filter internal-inbound-ipv6 term 1 then accept\nset firewall family inet6 filter internal-inbound-ipv6 term default then log\nset firewall family inet6 filter internal-inbound-ipv6 term default then syslog\nset firewall family inet6 filter internal-inbound-ipv6 term default then discard\n\nset interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family inet filter input internal-inbound-ipv4\nset interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family inet6 filter input internal-inbound-ipv6"},"impact":0.7,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target Juniper EX Series Switches Router"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-57474r844097_chk","severity":"high","gid":"V-254022","rid":"SV-254022r844099_rule","stig_id":"JUEX-RT-000500","gtitle":"SRG-NET-000205-RTR-000014","fix_id":"F-57425r844098_fix","documentable":null,"cci":["CCI-001094"],"nist":["SC-5 (1)"]}},{"id":"SV-254023","code":"control 'SV-254023' do\n  title 'The Juniper perimeter router must be configured to block all packets with any IP options.'\n  desc 'Packets with IP options are not fast switched and must be punted to the route engine (RE).

To avoid the problem of a packet looping in the provider core, thereby adding more overhead, the PE devices must enforce a split-horizon principle for the emulated virtual circuits; that is, if a packet is received on an emulated virtual circuit, it is not forwarded on any other virtual circuit.","descriptions":{"default":"A virtual forwarding instance (VFI) must be created on each participating PE router for each customer VLAN using VPLS for carrier Ethernet services. The VFI specifies the VPN ID of a VPLS domain, the addresses of other PE routers in the domain, and the type of tunnel signaling and encapsulation mechanism for each peer PE router. The set of VFIs formed by the interconnection of the emulated VCs is called a VPLS instance, which forms the logic bridge over the MPLS core network.\n\nThe PE routers use the VFI with a unique VPN ID to establish a full mesh of emulated virtual circuits or pseudowires to all the other PE routers in the VPLS instance.

By default, Juniper devices configured as PE routers and VPLS enforce split horizon operation. Except for H-VPLS, Juniper devices do not support disabling split horizon operation.\n\nLDP signaled VPLS requires a full mesh topology, which can lead to scaling issues. Hierarchical VPLS (H-VPLS) partitions the VPLS domains into mesh groups, reducing the required number of pseudo wires. However, the inner VPLS domain may require split horizon be disabled. Juniper devices support these scenarios with the \"local-switching\" command. Ensure mesh groups supporting H-VPLS do not have the \"local-switching\" directive enabled, unless required, as shown in the following example.

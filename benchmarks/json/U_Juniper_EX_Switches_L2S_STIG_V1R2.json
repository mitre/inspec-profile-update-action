Verify at least a third queue (Voice) is active with an appropriate bandwidth allocation. Verify Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) phones are connected to VoIP interfaces and there is a separate VoIP Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN).\n\nFor example, assume 20 percent VoIP traffic on \"voip\" VLAN 119 and normal production traffic is on \"data\" VLAN 150.

An STP loop is created when an STP blocking port in a redundant topology erroneously transitions to the forwarding state. In its operation, STP relies on continuous reception and transmission of BPDUs based on the port role. The designated port transmits BPDUs, and the non-designated port receives BPDUs. When one of the ports in a physically redundant topology no longer receives BPDUs, the STP conceives that the topology is loop free. Eventually, the blocking port from the alternate or backup port becomes a designated port and moves to a forwarding state. This situation creates a loop. The loop protection feature makes additional checks.

Allowing trunked interfaces to accept untagged data packets may unintentionally expose VLANs to unauthorized devices that could result in network exploration, unauthorized resource access, or a DoS condition. If a network function requires a native VLAN, and access interfaces are members of the assigned VLAN, authorized devices connected to those interfaces may gain unauthorized access to protected resources.","check":"Review the switch configurations and examine all access interfaces.

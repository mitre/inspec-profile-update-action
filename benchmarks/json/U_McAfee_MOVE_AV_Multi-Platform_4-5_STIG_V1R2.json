Typically, file scans are very fast. However, file scans may take longer due to large file size, file type, or heavy load on the SVM. If the file scan takes longer than the scan timeout limit, the file access is allowed and a scan timeout event is generated. Setting the timeout too low may result in scans of a file terminating before the scan is completed, resulting in malware potentially going undetected.","check":"Access the McAfee ePO console.\n\nSelect Menu >> Policy >> Policy Catalog and then select \"MOVE AntiVirus 4.5.0\" from the Product list.\n\nFrom the Category list, select \"On Access Scan\".\n\nSelect each configured On Access Scan policy.\n\nUnder \"Scan\", verify \"Specify maximum time for each file scan\" is set to \"45\" seconds or more.\n\nIf \"Specify maximum time for each file scan\" is not set to \"45\" seconds or more, this is a finding.","fix":"Access the McAfee ePO console.\n\nSelect Menu >> Policy >> Policy Catalog and then select \"MOVE AntiVirus 4.5.0\" from the Product list.\n\nFrom the Category list, select \"On Access Scan\".\n\nSelect the On Access Scan policy to be configured.\n\nUnder \"Scan\", set \"Specify maximum time for each file scan\" to \"45\" seconds or more.\n\nClick \"Save\"."},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target McAfee MOVE MultiPlatform Client 4.5"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-78095r1_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-78527","rid":"SV-93233r1_rule","stig_id":"MV45-OAS-000002","gtitle":"MV45-OAS-000002","fix_id":"F-85261r1_fix","documentable":null,"cci":["CCI-001242"],"nist":["SI-3 c 1"]}},{"id":"SV-93235","code":"control 'SV-93235' do\n  title 'The McAfee MOVE AV On Access Scan Policy must be configured to cache scan results for files smaller than 40 MB.'\n  desc 'This setting configures the maximum file size (in MB) up to which scan results should be cached.

Deleting files found to contain malware, while also moving them to quarantine, will allow the files to be rendered useless but are recoverable in the event of false positive.","check":"Access the McAfee ePO console.\n\nSelect Menu >> Policy >> Policy Catalog and then select \"MOVE AntiVirus 4.5.0\" from the Product list.\n\nFrom the Category list, select \"On Demand Scan\".\n\nSelect each configured On Demand Scan policy.\n\nClick \"Show Advanced\".\n\nUnder \"Actions\", verify the \"Threat detection first response\" is configured for \"Delete files automatically and quarantine\".\n\nIf the \"Threat detection first response\" is not configured for \"Delete files automatically and quarantine\", this is a finding.","fix":"Access the McAfee ePO console.\n\nSelect Menu >> Policy >> Policy Catalog and then select \"MOVE AntiVirus 4.5.0\" from the Product list.\n\nFrom the Category list, select \"On Demand Scan\".\n\nSelect each configured On Demand Scan policy.\n\nClick \"Show Advanced\".\n\nUnder \"Actions\", configure the \"Threat detection first response\" for \"Delete files automatically and quarantine\".\n\nClick \"Save\"."},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target McAfee MOVE MultiPlatform Client 4.5"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-78121r1_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-78551","rid":"SV-93257r1_rule","stig_id":"MV45-ODS-000005","gtitle":"MV45-ODS-000005","fix_id":"F-85287r1_fix","documentable":null,"cci":["CCI-001241"],"nist":["SI-3 c 1"]}},{"id":"SV-93259","code":"control 'SV-93259' do\n  title 'The McAfee MOVE AV On Demand Scan policy must be configured to scan all file types.'\n  desc 'When scanning for malware, excluding specific file types will increase the risk of a malware-infected file going undetected.

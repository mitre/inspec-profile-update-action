When this occurs, the organization either cannot accomplish its mission or must operate at degraded capacity.\n\nIndividuals of concern can include hostile insiders or external adversaries that have successfully breached the information system and are using the system as a platform to launch cyberattacks on third-parties.\n\nApplications and application developers must take the steps needed to ensure users cannot use an authorized application to launch DoS attacks against other systems and networks. For example, applications may include mechanisms that throttle network traffic so users are not able to generate unlimited network traffic via the application. Limiting system resources that are allocated to any user to a bare minimum may also reduce the ability of users to launch some DoS attacks.\n\nThe methods employed to counter this risk will be dependent upon the application layer methods that can be used to exploit it.","check":"Using a web browser on a system that has connectivity to the Tanium Application, access the Tanium Application web user interface (UI). \n\nLog on with CAC.\n\nClick on the navigation button (hamburger menu) on the top left of the console.\n\nClick on \"Administration\".\n\nSelect the \"Global Settings\" tab.\n\nIn the \"Show Settings Containing:\" search box type \"RandomSensorDelayInSeconds\".\n\nClick \"Enter\".\n\nIf no results are returned, this is a finding.\n\nIf results are returned for \"RandomSensorDelayInSeconds\", but do not match the defined value in the system documentation, this is a finding.","fix":"Using a web browser on a system that has connectivity to the Tanium Application, access the Tanium Application web user interface (UI).\n\nLog on with CAC.\n\nClick on the navigation button (hamburger menu) on the top left of the console.\n\nClick on \"Administration\".\n\nSelect the \"Global Settings\" tab.\n\nClick on \"New Setting\".\n\nIn \"New System Setting\" dialog box, enter \"RandomSensorDelayInSeconds\" for \"Setting Name:\".\n\nConsult with a Tanium TAM for an appropriate value for a given network.\n\nEnter the value for \"Setting Value:\".\n\nSelect \"Clients\" from \"Affects\" drop-down list.\n\nSelect \"Numeric\" from \"Value Type\" drop-down list.\n\nClick \"Save\".\n\nDocument the value for later use."},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target Tanium 7.3"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-37230r610635_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-234045","rid":"SV-234045r612749_rule","stig_id":"TANS-CL-000013","gtitle":"SRG-APP-000246","fix_id":"F-37195r610636_fix","documentable":null,"legacy":["SV-102163","V-92061"],"cci":["CCI-001094"],"nist":["SC-5 (1)"]}},{"id":"SV-234046","code":"control 'SV-234046' do\n  title 'Tanium endpoint files must be excluded from host-based intrusion prevention intervention.'\n  desc 'Similar to any other host-based applications, the Tanium Client is subject to the restrictions other System-level software may place on an operating environment.

The Tanium environment can perform hundreds or thousands of times faster than other security or systems management tools because the Tanium Clients communicate in secure, linearly-controlled peer-to-peer rings. Because clients dynamically communicate with other nearby agents based on proximity and latency, rings tend to form automatically to match a customer's topology--endpoints in California will form one ring while endpoints in Germany will form a separate ring.\n\nhttps://docs.tanium.com/platform_install/platform_install/reference_network_ports.html","check":"Consult with the Tanium System Administrator to verify which firewall is being used as a host-based firewall on the Tanium Server.\n\nAccess the host-based firewall configuration on the Tanium Server.\n\nValidate rules exist, as required, to include:\n\nBetween Tanium Clients or Zone Clients over TCP port 17472, bi-directionally.\n\nIf a host-based firewall rule does not exist to allow TCP port 17472, bi-directionally, this is a finding.\n\nConsult with the network firewall administrator and validate rules exist for the following:\n\nAllow TCP traffic on port 17472 from any computer to be managed on a local area network to any other computer to be managed on the same local area network.\n\nIf a network firewall rule does not exist to allow TCP port 17472 from any managed computer to any other managed computer on the same local area network, this is a finding.","fix":"Configure host-based and network firewall rules as required, to include Tanium Clients or Zone Clients over TCP port 17472, bi-directionally.\n\nAllow TCP traffic on port 17472 from any computer to be managed on a local area network to any other computer to be managed on the same local area network."},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target Tanium 7.3"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-37274r610767_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-234089","rid":"SV-234089r612749_rule","stig_id":"TANS-SV-000017","gtitle":"SRG-APP-000142","fix_id":"F-37239r610768_fix","documentable":null,"legacy":["SV-102251","V-92149"],"cci":["CCI-000382"],"nist":["CM-7 b"]}},{"id":"SV-234090","code":"control 'SV-234090' do\n  title 'Firewall rules must be configured on the Tanium Zone Server for Client-to-Zone Server communications.'\n  desc 'In customer environments using the Tanium Zone Server, a Tanium Client may be configured to point to a Zone Server instead of a Tanium Server.

A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational information system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user access) without terminating network sessions.\n\nSession termination terminates all processes associated with a user's logical session except those processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated.\n\nConditions or trigger events requiring automatic session termination can include, for example, organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, and time-of-day restrictions on information system use.\n\nThis capability is typically reserved for specific application system functionality where the system owner, data owner, or organization requires additional assurance. Based upon requirements and events specified by the data or application owner, the application developer must incorporate logic into the application that will provide a control mechanism that disconnects users upon the defined event trigger. The methods for incorporating this requirement will be determined and specified on a case-by-case basis during the application design and development stages.\n\nLeaving sessions open indefinitely is a major security risk. An attacker can easily use an already authenticated session to access the hosted application as the previously authenticated user. By closing sessions after an absolute period of time, the user is forced to re-authenticate, guaranteeing the session is still in use.

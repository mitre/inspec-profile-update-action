It takes advantage of the dynamic execution capabilities of various programming languages, including dialects of SQL. In such cases, the attacker deduces the manner in which SQL statements are being processed, either from inside knowledge or by observing system behavior in response to invalid inputs. When the attacker identifies scenarios where SQL queries are being assembled by application code (which may be within the database or separate from it) and executed dynamically, the attacker is then able to craft input strings that subvert the intent of the query. Potentially, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to data, including security settings, and severely corrupt or destroy the database.\n\nThe principal protection against code injection is not to use dynamic execution except where it provides necessary functionality that cannot be utilized otherwise. Use strongly typed data items rather than general-purpose strings as input parameters to task-specific, pre-compiled stored procedures and functions (and triggers).\n\nThis calls for inspection of application source code, which will require collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers, and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored.

Thus, while Mandatory Access Control imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity level, this requirement permits the subject to pass the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level.\n\nThe policy is bound by the information system boundary. Once the information is passed outside of the control of the information system, additional means may be required to ensure the constraints remain in effect. While the older, more traditional definitions of discretionary access control require identity-based access control, that limitation is not required for this use of discretionary access control.\n\n","check":"Review the MongoDB Configuration file (default location: /etc/mongod.conf).\n\nIf the file does not contain the following entry, this is a finding. \n\nsecurity:\n    authorization: enabled","fix":"Enable authentication for MongoDB by following the instructions here: https://docs.mongodb.com/v4.4/tutorial/enable-authentication/\n\nCreate an administrative user in MongoDB:\n\n use admin\n db.createUser(\n  {\n    user: \"UserAdmin\",\n    pwd: passwordPrompt(), // or cleartext password\n    roles: [ { role: \"userAdminAnyDatabase\", db: \"admin\" }, \"readWriteAnyDatabase\" ]\n  }\n)\n\nEnable authorization by adding the following entry to the %MongoDB configuration file%:\n\nsecurity:\n    authorization: enabled\n\nRestart the MongoDB service from the OS.\n\n sudo service mongod restart\n\nThe createUser and createRole MongoDB commands will be used to add the required users and roles per organizational or site-specific documentation.\n\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/v4.4/reference/command/createUser/\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/v4.4/reference/command/createRole/"},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target MongoDB Enterprise Advanced 4.x"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-55601r813815_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-252145","rid":"SV-252145r855504_rule","stig_id":"MD4X-00-001200","gtitle":"SRG-APP-000328-DB-000301","fix_id":"F-55551r813816_fix","satisfies":["SRG-APP-000328-DB-000301","SRG-APP-000340-DB-000304"],"documentable":null,"cci":["CCI-002165","CCI-002235"],"nist":["AC-3 (4)","AC-6 (10)"]}},{"id":"SV-252146","code":"control 'SV-252146' do\n  title 'MongoDB must use NIST FIPS 140-2 or 140-3 validated cryptographic modules for cryptographic operations.'\n  desc 'The use of weak or not validated cryptographic algorithms undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption and digital signatures to protect data.

By default, if the location information in the cached form and the saved form to not match, the form cannot be opened without prompting the user for consent.","check":"The policy value for User Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> Microsoft InfoPath 2010 -> Security “Disable opening forms with managed code from the Internet security zone” must be set to “Enabled”.\n\nProcedure: Use the Windows Registry Editor to navigate to the following key: \n\nHKCU\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Office\\14.0\\infopath\\security\n\nCriteria: If the value RunManagedCodeFromInternet is REG_DWORD = 1, this is not a finding.","fix":"Set the policy value for User Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> Microsoft InfoPath 2010 -> Security “Disable opening forms with managed code from the Internet security zone” to “Enabled”."},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target Microsoft InfoPath 2010"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-34216r1_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-26620","rid":"SV-34123r1_rule","stig_id":"DTOO296 - InfoPath","gtitle":"DTOO296 - Managed code from the Internet","fix_id":"F-29907r1_fix","documentable":null,"responsibility":["System Administrator","Information Assurance Officer"],"cci":["CCI-001170"],"nist":["SC-18 (4)"]}},{"id":"SV-34221","code":"control 'SV-34221' do\n  title 'A form that is digitally signed must be displayed with a warning.'\n  desc 'This setting controls whether the user sees a dialog box when opening Microsoft InfoPath forms containing digitally signed content.

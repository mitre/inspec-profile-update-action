These plugins are responsible both for the management of encryption keys and for the actual encryption and decryption of data. MariaDB supports the use of multiple encryption keys. Each encryption key uses a 32-bit integer as a key identifier. If the specific plugin supports key rotation, then encryption keys can also be rotated, which creates a new version of the encryption key. \n\nThe File Key Management plugin that ships with MariaDB is a key management and encryption plugin that reads encryption keys from a plain-text file. Although the plugin's shared library is distributed with MariaDB by default, the plugin is not installed by MariaDB by default. The plugin can be installed by providing the --plugin-load or the --plugin-load-add options. This can be specified as a command-line argument to mysqld or it can be specified in a relevant server option group in an option file. For example:\n[mariadb]\n...\nplugin_load_add = file_key_management\n\nCreating the Key File: To encrypt tables with encryption keys using the File Key Management plugin, first create the file that contains the encryption keys. The file must contain two pieces of information for each encryption key. First, each encryption key must be identified with a 32-bit integer as the key identifier. Second, the encryption key itself must be provided in hex-encoded form. These two pieces of information must be separated by a semicolon. \n\nFor example, the file is formatted in the following way:\n <encryption_key_id1>;<hex-encoded_encryption_key1>\n <encryption_key_id2>;<hex-encoded_encryption_key2>\n\nThe key file can also be optionally encrypted to make it less accessible from the file system. That is explained further in the section below.\n\nThe File Key Management plugin uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to encrypt data, which supports 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit encryption keys. Therefore, the plugin also supports 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit encryption keys.\n\nRandom encryption keys can be generated using the openssl rand command. For example, to create a random 256-bit (32-byte) encryption key, run the following command:\n\n$ openssl rand -hex 32\na7addd9adea9978fda19f21e6be987880e68ac92632ca052e5bb42b1a506939a\n\nCopy this encryption key to the key file using a text editor, or append a series of keys to a new key file. For example, to append three new encryption keys to a new key file, execute the following:\n\n$ sudo openssl rand -hex 32 >> /etc/mysql/encryption/keyfile\n$ sudo openssl rand -hex 32 >> /etc/mysql/encryption/keyfile\n$ sudo openssl rand -hex 32 >> /etc/mysql/encryption/keyfile\n\nThe new key file would look something like the following after this step:\n\na7addd9adea9978fda19f21e6be987880e68ac92632ca052e5bb42b1a506939a\n49c16acc2dffe616710c9ba9a10b94944a737de1beccb52dc1560abfdd67388b\n8db1ee74580e7e93ab8cf157f02656d356c2f437d548d5bf16bf2a56932954a3\n\nThe key file still needs to have a key identifier for each encryption key added to the beginning of each line. Key identifiers do not need to be contiguous. Open the new key file in the preferred text editor and add the key identifiers. For example, the key file would look something like the following after this step:\n\n1;a7addd9adea9978fda19f21e6be987880e68ac92632ca052e5bb42b1a506939a\n2;49c16acc2dffe616710c9ba9a10b94944a737de1beccb52dc1560abfdd67388b\n100;8db1ee74580e7e93ab8cf157f02656d356c2f437d548d5bf16bf2a56932954a3\n\nThe key identifiers give the user a way to reference the encryption keys from MariaDB. In the example above, encryption keys can be referenced using the key identifiers 1, 2, or 100 with the ENCRYPTION_KEY_ID table option or with system variables such as innodb_default_encryption_key_id.

When the attacker identifies scenarios where SQL queries are being assembled by application code (which may be within the database or separate from it) and executed dynamically, the attacker is then able to craft input strings that subvert the intent of the query. Potentially, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to data, including security settings, and severely corrupt or destroy the database.\n\nThe principal protection against code injection is not to use dynamic execution except where it provides necessary functionality that cannot be used otherwise. Use strongly typed data items rather than general-purpose strings as input parameters to task-specific, pre-compiled stored procedures and functions (and triggers).\n\nWhen dynamic execution is necessary, ways to mitigate the risk include the following, which should be implemented both in the on-screen application and at the database level, in the stored procedures:\n - Allow strings as input only when necessary. \n - Rely on data typing to validate numbers, dates, etc. Do not accept invalid values. If substituting other values for them, think carefully about whether this could be subverted.\n - Limit the size of input strings to what is truly necessary.\n - If single quotes/apostrophes, double quotes, semicolons, equal signs, angle brackets, or square brackets will never be valid as input, reject them.\n - If comment markers will never be valid as input, reject them. In SQL, these are -- or /* */ \n - If HTML and XML tags, entities, comments, etc., will never be valid, reject them.\n - If wildcards are present, reject them unless truly necessary. In SQL these are the underscore and the percentage sign, and the word ESCAPE is also a clue that wildcards are in use.\n - If SQL key words, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP, ESCAPE, UNION, GRANT, REVOKE, DENY, MODIFY will never be valid, reject them. Use case-insensitive comparisons when searching for these. Bear in mind that some of these words, particularly Grant (as a person s name), could also be valid input. \n - If there are range limits on the values that may be entered, enforce those limits.\n - Institute procedures for inspection of programs for correct use of dynamic coding, by a party other than the developer.\n - Conduct rigorous testing of program modules that use dynamic coding, searching for ways to subvert the intended use.\n - Record the inspection and testing in the system documentation.\n - Bear in mind that all this applies not only to screen input, but also to the values in an incoming message to a web service or to a stored procedure called by a software component that has not itself been hardened in these ways. Not only can the caller be subject to such vulnerabilities; it may itself be the attacker.\n\nThis calls for inspection of application source code, which will require collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers, and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored. At a minimum, the DBA must attempt to obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue has been addressed and must document what has been discovered.","check":"Review MariaDB source code (stored procedures, functions, triggers) and application source code to identify cases of dynamic code execution.\n\nIf dynamic code execution is employed without protective measures against code injection, this is a finding.","fix":"Where dynamic code execution is used, modify the code to implement protections against code injection."},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target MariaDB Enterprise 10.x"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-57168r841671_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-253716","rid":"SV-253716r841673_rule","stig_id":"MADB-10-005900","gtitle":"SRG-APP-000251-DB-000392","fix_id":"F-57119r841672_fix","documentable":null,"cci":["CCI-001310"],"nist":["SI-10"]}},{"id":"SV-253717","code":"control 'SV-253717' do\n  title \"MariaDB must automatically terminate a user's session after organization-defined conditions or trigger events requiring session disconnect.\"\n  desc \"This addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions in contrast to the termination of network connections that are associated with communications sessions (i.e., network disconnect).

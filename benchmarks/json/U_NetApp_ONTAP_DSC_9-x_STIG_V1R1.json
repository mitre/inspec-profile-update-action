An example of DAC includes user-controlled file permissions.\n\nWhen discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or objects. A subject that is constrained in its operation by Mandatory Access Control policies is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this requirement. Thus, while Mandatory Access Control imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity level, this requirement permits the subject to pass the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level. The policy is bounded by the information system boundary. Once the information is passed outside of the control of the information system, additional means may be required to ensure the constraints remain in effect. While the older, more traditional definitions of discretionary access control require identity-based access control, that limitation is not required for this use of discretionary access control.\n\nThe discretionary access control policies and the subjects and objects are defined uniquely for each network device, so they cannot be specified in the requirement.","check":"Use \"security login show -vserver <vserver_name> -role vsadmin\" to see users with DAC over a vserver domain within ONTAP.\n\nIf ONTAP does not enforce organization-defined DAC policies, this is a finding.","fix":"Configure new users with DAC in ONTAP for a specific vserver domain with “security login create -vserver <vserver_name> -role vsadmin -user-or-group-name <user_name> -application ssh -authentication-method password\"."},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target NetApp ONTAP DSC 9.x"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-50360r769114_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-246928","rid":"SV-246928r769116_rule","stig_id":"NAOT-AC-000007","gtitle":"SRG-APP-000328-NDM-000286","fix_id":"F-50314r769115_fix","documentable":null,"cci":["CCI-002165"],"nist":["AC-3 (4)"]}},{"id":"SV-246929","code":"control 'SV-246929' do\n  title 'ONTAP must enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of management information.'\n  desc 'A mechanism to detect and prevent unauthorized communication flow must be configured or provided as part of the system design.

When administrators are assigned to the organizational roles, they inherit the authorizations or privileges defined for those roles. RBAC simplifies privilege administration for organizations because privileges are not assigned directly to every administrator (which can be a significant number of individuals for mid- to large-size organizations) but are instead acquired through role assignments. RBAC can be implemented either as a mandatory or discretionary form of access control.\n\nThe RBAC policies and the subjects and objects are defined uniquely for each network device, so they cannot be specified in the requirement.","check":"Use \"security login role show\" to see role-based access policies defined in ONTAP.\n\nIf ONTAP does not enforce organization-defined role-based access control policies over defined subjects and objects, this is a finding.","fix":"Configure role-based access policies with \"security login role create -role <name>\" to create new roles, and \"security login create -user-or-group-name <user_name> -role <name>\" to assign the role to a specific user or group."},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target NetApp ONTAP DSC 9.x"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-50374r769156_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-246942","rid":"SV-246942r769158_rule","stig_id":"NAOT-CM-000005","gtitle":"SRG-APP-000329-NDM-000287","fix_id":"F-50328r769157_fix","documentable":null,"cci":["CCI-000366","CCI-002169"],"nist":["CM-6 b","AC-3 (7)"]}},{"id":"SV-246943","code":"control 'SV-246943' do\n  title 'ONTAP must generate log records for a locally developed list of auditable events.'\n  desc 'Auditing and logging are key components of any security architecture.

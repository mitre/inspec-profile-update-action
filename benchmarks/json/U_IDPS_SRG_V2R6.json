An automatic update process ensures this important task is performed without the need for system administrator intervention.\n\nThe IDPS is a key malicious code protection mechanism in the enclave infrastructure. To ensure this protection is responsive to changes in malicious code threats, IDPS components must be automatically updated, including anti-virus signatures, detection heuristics, vendor-provided rules, and vendor-provided signatures.\n\nIf a DoD patch management server or update repository having the tested/verified updates is available for the IDPS component, the components must be configured to automatically check this server/site for updates and install new updates. \n\nIf a DoD server/site is not available, the component must be configured to automatically check a trusted vendor site for updates. A trusted vendor is either commonly used by DoD, specifically approved by DoD, the vendor from which the equipment was purchased, or approved by the local program's CCB.","check":"Verify the IDPS

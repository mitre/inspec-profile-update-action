Because the responsibility for meeting this objective is transferred to the AAA broker, this requirement is not applicable for the local network device. This requirement may be verified by demonstration or configuration review.\n\nVerify the network device is configured to map each validated certificate to a unique, centralized user account for all interactive users. If the network device is not configured to map each validated certificate to a unique, centralized user account for all interactive users, this is a finding.\n\nNote: If local user accounts are used on the device, this requirement cannot be met in its entirety and it is a permanent finding. This may be the case if AO’s choose to accept the risk of using local accounts on network devices for small, isolated environments where centralized directory services are not available in the infrastructure or where they are not cost effective to implement and maintain. In such cases, this requirement can be mitigated to a CAT III if the network device is configured to map each validated certificate to a unique, local user account for all interactive users. \n\nNote: This requirement is not applicable to the emergency account of last resort nor for service accounts (non-interactive users).

Granularity of time measurements refers to the precision available in time stamp values. Granularity coarser than one second is not sufficient for audit trail purposes. Time stamp values are typically presented with three or more decimal places of seconds; however, the actual granularity may be coarser than the apparent precision.

See supplementary content APPENDIX-F for instructions on configuring PGDATA, APPENDIX-H for PGVER, and APPENDIX-I for PGLOG.\n\nTo ensure logging is enabled, review supplementary content APPENDIX-C for instructions on enabling logging.\n\nFor audit logging using pgaudit is recommended. For instructions on how to setup pgaudit, see supplementary content APPENDIX-B.\n\nAs a superuser (postgres), any pgaudit parameter can be changed in postgresql.conf. Configurations can only be changed by a superuser.\n\n### Example: Change Auditing To Log Any ROLE Statements\n\nNote: This will override any setting already configured.\n\nAlter the configuration to do role-based logging:\n\n$ sudo su - postgres\n$ vi ${PGDATA?}/postgresql.conf\n\nAdd the following parameters (or edit existing parameters):\n\npgaudit.log = 'role'\n\nNow, as the system administrator, reload the server with the new configuration:\n\n$ sudo systemctl reload postgresql-${PGVER?}\n\n### Example: Set An Auditing Role And Grant Privileges\n\nAn audit role can be configured and granted privileges to specific tables and columns that need logging.\n\n##### Create Test Table\n\n$ sudo su - postgres\n$ psql -c \"CREATE TABLE public.stig_audit_example(id INT, name TEXT, password TEXT);\"\n\n##### Define Auditing Role\n\nAs PostgreSQL superuser (such as postgres), add the following to postgresql.conf or any included configuration files.\n\n$ sudo su - postgres\n$ vi ${PGDATA?}/postgresql.conf\n\nAdd the following parameters (or edit existing parameters):\n\npgaudit.role = 'auditor'\n\nNow, as the system administrator, reload the server with the new configuration:\n\n$ sudo systemctl reload postgresql-${PGVER?} \n\nNext in PostgreSQL create a new role:\n\npostgres=# CREATE ROLE auditor;\npostgres=# GRANT select(password) ON public.stig_audit_example TO auditor;\n\nNote: This role is created with NOLOGIN privileges by default.\n\nNow any SELECT on the column password will be logged:\n\n$ sudo su - postgres\n$ psql -c \"SELECT password FROM public.stig_audit_example;\"\n$ cat ${PGDATA?}/${PGLOG?}/<latest_log>\n< 2016-01-28 16:46:09.038 UTC bob postgres: >LOG: AUDIT: OBJECT,6,1,READ,SELECT,TABLE,public.stig_audit_example,SELECT password FROM stig_audit_example;,<none>\n\n## Change Configurations During A Specific Timeframe\n\nDeploy PostgreSQL that allows audit configuration changes to take effect within the timeframe required by the application owner and without involving actions or events that the application owner rules unacceptable.\n\nCrontab can be used to do this.\n\nFor a specific audit role:\n\n# Grant specific audit privileges to an auditing role at 5 PM every day of the week, month, year at the 0 minute mark.\n0 5 * * * postgres /usr/bin/psql -c \"GRANT select(password) ON public.stig_audit_example TO auditor;\"\n# Revoke specific audit privileges to an auditing role at 5 PM every day of the week, month, year at the 0 minute mark.\n0 17 * * * postgres /usr/bin/psql -c \"REVOKE select(password) ON public.stig_audit_example FROM auditor;\""},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target Crunchy Data PostgreSQL"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-36794r607023_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-233600","rid":"SV-233600r617424_rule","stig_id":"CD12-00-010000","gtitle":"SRG-APP-000516-DB-000363","fix_id":"F-36759r617423_fix","documentable":null,"cci":["CCI-001914"],"nist":["AU-12 (3)"]}},{"id":"SV-233601","code":"control 'SV-233601' do\n  title 'PostgreSQL must require users to reauthenticate when organization-defined circumstances or situations require reauthentication.'\n  desc 'The DoD standard for authentication of an interactive user is the presentation of a Common Access Card (CAC) or other physical token bearing a valid, current, DoD-issued Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate, coupled with a Personal Identification Number (PIN) to be entered by the user at the beginning of each session and whenever reauthentication is required.\n\nWithout reauthentication, users may access resources or perform tasks for which they do not have authorization.\n\nWhen applications provide the capability to change security roles or escalate the functional capability of the application, it is critical the user re-authenticate.\n\nIn addition to the reauthentication requirements associated with session locks, organizations may require reauthentication of individuals and/or devices in other situations, including (but not limited to) the following circumstances:\n\n(i) When authenticators change;\n(ii) When roles change;\n(iii) When security categorized information systems change;\n(iv) When the execution of privileged functions occurs;\n(v) After a fixed period of time; or\n(vi) Periodically.\n\nWithin the DoD, the minimum circumstances requiring reauthentication are privilege escalation and role changes.'\n  desc 'check', \"Determine all situations where a user must re-authenticate.

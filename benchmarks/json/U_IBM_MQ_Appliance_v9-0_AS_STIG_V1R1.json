Attackers that are able to exploit an inactive identifier can potentially obtain and maintain undetected access to the application. Owners of inactive accounts will not notice if unauthorized access to their user account has been obtained. \n\nApplications need to track periods of inactivity and disable application identifiers after 35 days of inactivity. \n\nManagement of user identifiers is not applicable to shared information system accounts (e.g., guest and anonymous accounts). It is commonly the case that a user account is the name of an information system account associated with an individual.\n\nTo avoid having to build complex user management capabilities directly into their application, wise developers leverage the underlying OS or other user account management infrastructure (AD, LDAP) that is already in place within the organization and meets organizational user account management requirements.\n\nReview IBM product documentation for the LDAP fields required when setting up a communication link with the LDAP server.\n\nNote: Multiple alternative LDAP hosts may be listed in the CONNAME parameter, separated by commas.\n\nReview IBM product documentation for the LDAP fields required when setting up a communication link with the LDAP server.\n\nSee https://ibm.biz/BdiBGu and https://ibm.biz/BdixXz for a detailed description of these options.","check":"To access the MQ Appliance CLI, for each queue manager, enter:\nmqcli\n\nTo identify the queue managers, enter:\ndspmq\n\nFor each queue manager identified, run the command:\nrunmqsc [queue name]\n\nTo display the active authentication object, enter:\nDIS QMGR CONNAUTH\n\nResult: QMNAME([queue mgr name]) CONNAUTH([auth object name])\n\nDIS AUTHINFO(auth object name)\n\nVerify that \"AUTHTYPE(IDPWLDAP)\" is displayed.\n\nVerify LDAP server user settings are configured to disable accounts after \"35\" days of inactivity.\n\nIf \"AUTHTYPE(IDPWLDAP)\" is not displayed or if the LDAP server user settings are not configured to disable accounts after \"35\" days of inactivity, this is a finding.","fix":"Specify LDAP as the authentication method for each queue manager.\n\nTo access the MQ Appliance CLI, enter:\nmqcli\n\nrunmqsc [queue manager name]\n\nDEFINE AUTHINFO('[Object name e.g., USE.LDAP]') \nAUTHTYPE(IDPWLDAP) \nCONNAME('[ldap1(port),ldap2(port),ldap3(port)]')  \nSECCOMM(YES)                                 [Ensures encryption is used]\nSHORTUSR('[short user name]') \nCHCKCLNT(REQUIRED) \nBASEDNU('base user DN') \nREPLACE\n\nALTER QMGR CONNAUTH('[AUTHINFO object name]')\nREFRESH SECURITY TYPE(CONNAUTH)\n\nEnter \"end\" to exit runmqsc mode.\n\nConfigure LDAP server to disable accounts after 35 days of inactivity."},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target IBM MQ Appliance v9.0 AS"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-74761r1_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-74903","rid":"SV-89577r1_rule","stig_id":"MQMH-AS-001080","gtitle":"SRG-APP-000163-AS-000111","fix_id":"F-81519r1_fix","documentable":null,"cci":["CCI-000795"],"nist":["IA-4 e"]}},{"id":"SV-89579","code":"control 'SV-89579' do\n  title 'The MQ Appliance messaging server must use an enterprise user management system to uniquely identify and authenticate users (or processes acting on behalf of organizational users).'\n  desc 'To assure accountability and prevent unauthorized access, application server users must be uniquely identified and authenticated.

These messaging server libraries must use NIST-approved or NSA-approved key management technology and processes when producing, controlling, or distributing symmetric and asymmetric keys.\n\nThe most common way devices (endpoints) may connect an MQ Appliance MQ queue manager is as an MQ client.

Although IPS might be more geared for detecting an overflow of the parser of the network stream, it isn’t as well geared for detecting threats within files. That is, it certainly can detect such file-based attacks, but attackers can go to great lengths to encode, encrypt, and obfuscate files to perform some malicious action—and it is very difficult to detect these attacks in Stream mode.","check":"Verify UTM and AV policies are configured.\n\n[edit]\nshow security utm\n\nIf a stanza does not exist for at least one UTM and one AV policy, this is a finding.\n\nIf the IDPS does not have UTM and AV capabilities and traffic is not forwarded to be inspected for AV and UTM threats, this is a finding.","fix":"Configure at least one policy for the UTM and AV policy using the commands and options for the [edit security utm] hierarchy.\n\nIf the UTM and AV licenses are not installed, IDPS must be installed in the architecture so that traffic is forwarded for deeper AV and UTM inspection.

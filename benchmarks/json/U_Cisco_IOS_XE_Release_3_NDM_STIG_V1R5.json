For each network device, known and potential DoS attacks must be identified and solutions for each type implemented. A variety of technologies exist to limit or, in some cases, eliminate the effects of DoS attacks (e.g., limiting processes or restricting the number of sessions the device opens at one time). Employing increased capacity and bandwidth, combined with service redundancy, may reduce the susceptibility to some DoS attacks.\n\nThe security safeguards cannot be defined at the DoD level because they vary according to the capabilities of the individual network devices and the security controls applied on the adjacent networks (for example, firewalls performing packet filtering to block DoS attacks).","check":"Determine whether control plane protection has been implemented on the Cisco IOS XE router by verifying traffic types have been classified based on importance levels and a policy has been configured to filter and rate limit the traffic according to each class.\n\nThe configuration should look similar to the following example:\n\nclass-map match-any CoPP_UNDESIRABLE\n match access-group name CoPP_UNDESIRABLE\nclass-map match-any CoPP_IMPORTANT\n match access-group name CoPP_IMPORTANT\n match protocol arp\nclass-map match-all CoPP_DEFAULT\n match access-group name CoPP_DEFAULT\n\npolicy-map CONTROL_PLANE_POLICY\n class CoPP_CRITICAL\n  police 512000 8000 conform-action transmit  exceed-action transmit \n class CoPP_IMPORTANT\n  police 256000 4000 conform-action transmit  exceed-action drop \n class CoPP_NORMAL\n  police 128000 2000 conform-action transmit  exceed-action drop \n class CoPP_UNDESIRABLE\n  police 8000 1000 conform-action drop  exceed-action drop \n class CoPP_DEFAULT\n  police 64000 1000 conform-action transmit  exceed-action drop \n\nIf control plane protection has not been implemented, this is a finding.\n\nIf control plane protection has been implemented but is not configured to verify traffic types have been classified based on importance levels and a policy has been configured to filter and rate limit the traffic according to each class, this is a finding.","fix":"Implement control plane protection by classifying traffic types based on importance and configure filters to restrict and rate limit the traffic directed to and processed by the route processor according to each class.\n\nThe configuration would look similar to the one below:\n\nclass-map match-any CoPP_UNDESIRABLE\n match access-group name CoPP_UNDESIRABLE\nclass-map match-any CoPP_IMPORTANT\n match access-group name CoPP_IMPORTANT\n match protocol arp\nclass-map match-all CoPP_DEFAULT\n match access-group name CoPP_DEFAULT\n\npolicy-map CONTROL_PLANE_POLICY\n class CoPP_CRITICAL\n  police 512000 8000 conform-action transmit  exceed-action transmit \n class CoPP_IMPORTANT\n  police 256000 4000 conform-action transmit  exceed-action drop \n class CoPP_NORMAL\n  police 128000 2000 conform-action transmit  exceed-action drop \n class CoPP_UNDESIRABLE\n  police 8000 1000 conform-action drop  exceed-action drop \n class CoPP_DEFAULT\n  police 64000 1000 conform-action transmit  exceed-action drop"},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target Cisco IOS XE NDM"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-74147r3_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-74057","rid":"SV-88731r2_rule","stig_id":"CISR-ND-000119","gtitle":"SRG-APP-000435-NDM-000315","fix_id":"F-80599r3_fix","documentable":null,"cci":["CCI-002385"],"nist":["SC-5 a"]}},{"id":"SV-88733","code":"control 'SV-88733' do\n  title 'If the Cisco IOS XE router uses mandatory access control, the Cisco IOS XE router  must enforce organization-defined mandatory access control policies over all subjects and objects.'\n  desc 'Mandatory access control policies constrain what actions subjects can take with information obtained from data objects for which they have already been granted access, thus preventing the subjects from passing the information to unauthorized subjects and objects.

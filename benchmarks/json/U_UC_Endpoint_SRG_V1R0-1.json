In its simplest form, a password verifier is a computational function that is capable of creating a hash of a password and determining if the value provided by the user matches the hash. A more secure version of verifying a user knowing a password is to store the result of an iterating hash function and a large random salt value as follows:\n\nH0 = H(pwd, H(salt))\nHn = H(Hn-1,H(salt))\n\nIn the above, \"n\" is a cryptographically strong random [*3] number. \"Hn\" is stored along with the salt. When the application wishes to verify that the user knows a password, it simply repeats the process and compares \"Hn\" with the stored \"Hn\". A salt is essentially a fixed-length cryptographically strong random value.\n\nAnother method is using a keyed hash message authentication code (HMAC).

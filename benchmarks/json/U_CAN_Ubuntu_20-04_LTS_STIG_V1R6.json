A variety of technologies exist to limit or, in some cases, eliminate the effects of DoS attacks (e.g., limiting processes or establishing memory partitions). Employing increased capacity and bandwidth, combined with service redundancy, may reduce the susceptibility to some DoS attacks.","check":"Verify an application firewall is configured to rate limit any connection to the system. \n \nCheck all the services listening to the ports with the following command: \n \n$ sudo ss -l46ut \n \nNetid               State                Recv-Q                Send-Q                               Local Address:Port                               Peer Address:Port               Process                \ntcp                 LISTEN               0                     128                                           [::]:ssh                                        [::]:* \n \nFor each entry, verify that the Uncomplicated Firewall is configured to rate limit the service ports with the following command: \n \n$ sudo ufw status \n \nStatus: active \n \nTo                         Action      From \n--                         ------      ---- \n22/tcp                     LIMIT       Anywhere                   \n22/tcp (v6)                LIMIT       Anywhere (v6) \n \nIf any port with a state of \"LISTEN\" is not marked with the \"LIMIT\" action, this is a finding.","fix":"Configure the application firewall to protect against or limit the effects of DoS attacks by ensuring the Ubuntu operating system is implementing rate-limiting measures on impacted network interfaces. \n \nCheck all the services listening to the ports with the following command: \n \n$ sudo ss -l46ut \n \nNetid               State                Recv-Q                Send-Q                               Local Address:Port                               Peer Address:Port               Process                \ntcp                 LISTEN               0                     128                                           [::]:ssh                                        [::]:* \n \nFor each service with a port listening to connections, run the following command, replacing \"[service]\" with the service that needs to be rate limited. \n \n$ sudo ufw limit [service] \n \nRate-limiting can also be done on an interface.

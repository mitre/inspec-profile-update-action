Disabling vsyscalls help to prevent return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks via buffer overflows and overruns.

Wireless peripherals (e.g., Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/IR keyboards, mice, and pointing devices and Near Field Communications [NFC]) present a unique challenge by creating an open, unsecured port on a computer. Wireless peripherals must meet DoD requirements for wireless data transmission and be approved for use by the Authorizing Official (AO). Although some wireless peripherals, such as mice and pointing devices, do not ordinarily carry information that need to be protected, modification of communications with these wireless peripherals may be used to compromise the OL 8 operating system. Communication paths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification. \n \nProtecting the confidentiality and integrity of communications with wireless peripherals can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical barriers to wireless radio frequencies) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques). If physical means of protection are employed, logical means (cryptography) do not have to be employed, and vice versa.

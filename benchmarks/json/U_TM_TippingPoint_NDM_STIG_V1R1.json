Port: 636 or your DoD LDAPS port, if different.\n6. Timeout: 30 seconds is the default.\n7. Admin name: the account that has privileges to access the directory schema – format is username@domain.name \n8. Admin password: password of previous admin account. \n9. User search base: this is the LDAP directory tree for the accounts that will be allowed. Example: ou=Trend Micro,dc=dod,dc=disa,dc=mil \n10. User search attribute: normally in DoD this is userPrincipalName.\n11. User display attribute: normally in DoD this is sAMAccountName.\n12. Group search base: this is the LDAP directory tree for the groups that will be allowed. Example: ou=Trend Micro,dc=dod,dc=disa,dc=mil \n13. Group name attribute: normally it is cn.\n14. Select the test button to ensure all configurations provided function correctly. \n15. Select OK.\n\nIV. Enable OCSP revocation checking: \n1. Under OCSP Settings, navigate to Certificate Management and Revocation >> New >> Certificate Authority. \n2. Type the full OCSP URI (e.g. http://ocsp.disa.mil).\n3. Repeat this step for all CA certificates in the CAC trust chain.\n4. Optionally, to add a CRL click New under Certificate Revocation Lists.\n5. Select the Certificate Authority. \n6. Type the full CRL path including to the specific CRL file (e.g. http://crl.disa.mil/certificate.crl).\n\nV. Enable CAC authentication/LDAPS authorization: \n1. Navigate to Admin >> Authentication and Groups >> Edit.\n2. Click Use CAC Authentication (ensure the local emergency user account is checked for local access in case of emergency troubleshooting). \n3. Select OK. \n4. Close the SMS client.\n\nVI. Test CAC authentication: \n1. Ensure one other smartcard reader is enabled in the device manager of the computer you are using. \n2. Open the SMS client. \n3. Type the hostname/IP of the SMS server.\n4. Ensuring the CAC/admin token is inserted in the reader, type the PIN of the CAC. \n5. Select the certificate to use to login.\n6. Select OK. \n7. User should be taken to the dashboard and configuration area of the SMS.\n\nVII. Troubleshooting: \n1. If you receive errors logging in with CAC go to the serial console of the SMS server. \n2. Login with the local account of last resort. \n3.

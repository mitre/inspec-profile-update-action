For non-kernel code, security function isolation is often achieved through file system protections that serve to protect the code on disk and address space protections that protect executing code.\n\nDevelopers and implementers can increase the assurance in security functions by employing well-defined security policy models; structured, disciplined, and rigorous hardware and software development techniques; and sound system/security engineering principles. Implementation may include isolation of memory space and libraries. Operating systems restrict access to security functions through the use of access control mechanisms and by implementing least privilege capabilities.","check":"Verify that TOSS verifies the correct operation of all security functions.\n\nCheck if \"SELinux\" is active and in \"Enforcing\" mode with the following command:\n\n$ sudo getenforce\nEnforcing\n\nIf \"SELinux\" is not active or not in \"Enforcing\" mode, this is a finding.","fix":"Configure the operating system to verify correct operation of all security functions.\n\nSet the \"SELinux\" status and the \"Enforcing\" mode by modifying the \"/etc/selinux/config\" file to have the following line:\n\nSELINUX=enforcing\n\nA reboot is required for the changes to take effect."},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target TOSS 4"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-56373r824082_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-252920","rid":"SV-252920r824084_rule","stig_id":"TOSS-04-010090","gtitle":"SRG-OS-000134-GPOS-00068","fix_id":"F-56323r824083_fix","documentable":null,"cci":["CCI-001084"],"nist":["SC-3"]}},{"id":"SV-252921","code":"control 'SV-252921' do\n  title 'TOSS must prevent unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system resources.'\n  desc 'Preventing unauthorized information transfers mitigates the risk of information, including encrypted representations of information, produced by the actions of prior users/roles (or the actions of processes acting on behalf of prior users/roles) from being available to any current users/roles (or current processes) that obtain access to shared system resources (e.g., registers, main memory, hard disks) after those resources have been released back to information systems.

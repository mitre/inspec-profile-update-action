Entropy in computer security is associated with the unpredictability of a source of randomness. The random source with high entropy tends to achieve a uniform distribution of random values. Random number generators are one of the most important building blocks of cryptosystems.  \n\nThe rngd service feeds random data from hardware device to kernel random device. Quality (nonpredictable) random number generation is important for several security functions (i.e., ciphers).","check":"Verify that RHEL 9 has enabled the hardware random number generator entropy gatherer service with the following command:\n\n$ systemctl is-active rngd\n\nactive\n\nIf the \"rngd\" service is not active, this is a finding.","fix":"Install the rng-tools package with the following command:\n\n$ sudo dnf install rng-tools\n\nThen enable the rngd service run the following command:\n\n$ sudo systemctl enable --now rngd"},"impact":0.3,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-61523r925331_chk","severity":"low","gid":"V-257782","rid":"SV-257782r925333_rule","stig_id":"RHEL-09-211035","gtitle":"SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227","fix_id":"F-61447r925332_fix","documentable":null,"cci":["CCI-000366"],"nist":["CM-6 b"]}},{"id":"SV-257783","code":"control 'SV-257783' do\n  title 'RHEL 9 systemd-journald service must be enabled.'\n  desc 'In the event of a system failure, RHEL 9 must preserve any information necessary to determine cause of failure and any information necessary to return to operations with least disruption to system processes.'\n  desc 'check', 'Verify that \"systemd-journald\" is active with the following command:\n\n$ systemctl is-active systemd-journald\n\nactive\n\nIf the systemd-journald service is not active, this is a finding.'\n  desc 'fix', 'To enable the systemd-journald service, run the following command:\n\n$ sudo systemctl enable --now systemd-journald'\n  impact 0.5\n  ref 'DPMS Target Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9'\n  tag check_id: 'C-61524r925334_chk'\n  tag severity: 'medium'\n  tag gid: 'V-257783'\n  tag rid: 'SV-257783r925336_rule'\n  tag stig_id: 'RHEL-09-211040'\n  tag gtitle: 'SRG-OS-000269-GPOS-00103'\n  tag fix_id: 'F-61448r925335_fix'\n  tag 'documentable'\n  tag cci: ['CCI-001665']\n  tag nist: ['SC-24']\nend","source_location":{"line":1,"ref":"U_RHEL_9_STIG_V1R1/controls/SV-257783.rb"},"title":"RHEL 9 systemd-journald service must be enabled.","desc":"In the event of a system failure, RHEL 9 must preserve any information necessary to determine cause of failure and any information necessary to return to operations with least disruption to system processes.","descriptions":{"default":"In the event of a system failure, RHEL 9 must preserve any information necessary to determine cause of failure and any information necessary to return to operations with least disruption to system processes.","check":"Verify that \"systemd-journald\" is active with the following command:\n\n$ systemctl is-active systemd-journald\n\nactive\n\nIf the systemd-journald service is not active, this is a finding.","fix":"To enable the systemd-journald service, run the following command:\n\n$ sudo systemctl enable --now systemd-journald"},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-61524r925334_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-257783","rid":"SV-257783r925336_rule","stig_id":"RHEL-09-211040","gtitle":"SRG-OS-000269-GPOS-00103","fix_id":"F-61448r925335_fix","documentable":null,"cci":["CCI-001665"],"nist":["SC-24"]}},{"id":"SV-257784","code":"control 'SV-257784' do\n  title 'The systemd Ctrl-Alt-Delete burst key sequence in RHEL 9 must be disabled.'\n  desc 'A locally logged-on user who presses Ctrl-Alt-Delete when at the console can reboot the system.

Wireless peripherals (e.g., Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/IR keyboards, mice and pointing devices, and near field communications [NFC]) present a unique challenge by creating an open, unsecured port on a computer. Wireless peripherals must meet DOD requirements for wireless data transmission and be approved for use by the Authorizing Official (AO). Even though some wireless peripherals, such as mice and pointing devices, do not ordinarily carry information that need to be protected, modification of communications with these wireless peripherals may be used to compromise the RHEL 9 operating system.\n\n","check":"Verify there are no wireless interfaces configured on the system with the following command:\n\nNote: This requirement is Not Applicable for systems that do not have physical wireless network radios.\n\n$ nmcli device status\n\nDEVICE                    TYPE            STATE                    CONNECTION\nvirbr0                      bridge         connected             virbr0\nwlp7s0                    wifi              connected            wifiSSID\nenp6s0                    ethernet     disconnected        --\np2p-dev-wlp7s0     wifi-p2p     disconnected        --\nlo                             loopback    unmanaged           --\nvirbr0-nic                tun              unmanaged          --\n\nIf a wireless interface is configured and has not been documented and approved by the information system security officer (ISSO), this is a finding.","fix":"Configure the system to disable all wireless network interfaces with the following command:\n\n$ nmcli radio all off"},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-61781r926105_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-258040","rid":"SV-258040r926107_rule","stig_id":"RHEL-09-291040","gtitle":"SRG-OS-000299-GPOS-00117","fix_id":"F-61705r926106_fix","satisfies":["SRG-OS-000299-GPOS-00117","SRG-OS-000300-GPOS-00118","SRG-OS-000424-GPOS-00188","SRG-OS-000481-GPOS-00481"],"documentable":null,"cci":["CCI-001443","CCI-001444","CCI-002418","CCI-002421"],"nist":["AC-18 (1)","AC-18 (1)","SC-8","SC-8 (1)"]}},{"id":"SV-258041","code":"control 'SV-258041' do\n  title 'RHEL 9 user account passwords for new users or password changes must have a 60-day maximum password lifetime restriction in /etc/login.defs.'\n  desc 'Any password, no matter how complex, can eventually be cracked; therefore, passwords need to be changed periodically.

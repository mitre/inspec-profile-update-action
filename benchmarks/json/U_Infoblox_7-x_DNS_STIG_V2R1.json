Establishing trust in the source is called data origin authentication. \n\nThe security objectives—and consequently the security services—that are required for securing the DNS query/response transaction are data origin authentication and data integrity verification.\n\nThe specification for a digital signature mechanism in the context of the DNS infrastructure is in IETF’s DNSSEC standard. In DNSSEC, trust in the public key (for signature verification) of the source is established not by going to a third party or a chain of third parties (as in public key infrastructure [PKI] chaining), but by starting from a trusted zone (such as the root zone) and establishing the chain of trust down to the current source of response through successive verifications of signature of the public key of a child by its parent. The public key of the trusted zone is called the trust anchor.","check":"Note: For Infoblox DNS systems on a Classified network, this requirement is Not Applicable.\n\nNavigate to Data Management >> DNS >> Grid DNS properties.\n\nToggle Advanced Mode click on \"DNSSEC\" tab, verify \"Enable DNSSEC\" is enabled.\n\nNavigate to Data Management >> DNS >> Zones.\n\nVerify that the \"Signed\" column is displayed.\nValidate that all external authoritative zones are signed by displaying \"Yes\".\nWhen complete, click \"Cancel\" to exit the \"Properties\" screen.\n\nIf DNSSEC is not enabled, and external authoritative zones are not signed, this is a finding.","fix":"Navigate to Data Management >> DNS >> Zones tab.\n\nPlace a check mark in the box next to the desired external authoritative zone.

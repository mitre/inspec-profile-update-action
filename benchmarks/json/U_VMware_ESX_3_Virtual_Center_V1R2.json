Each virtual adapter also has an effective MAC address that filters out incoming network traffic with a destination MAC address different from the effective MAC address. A virtual adapter’s effective MAC address and initial MAC address are the same when they are initially created. However, the virtual machine’s operating system may alter the effective MAC address to another value at any time. If the virtual machine operating system changes the MAC address, the operating system can send frames with an impersonated source MAC address at any time. This allows an operating system to stage malicious attacks on the devices in a network by impersonating a network adapter authorized by the receiving network. System administrators can use virtual switch security profiles on ESX Server hosts to protect against this type of attack by setting two options on the virtual switches. These options are MAC Address Changes and Forged Transmits.\n\nMAC address changes are set to accept by default meaning that the virtual switch accepts requests to change the effective MAC address. The MAC Address Changes option setting affects traffic received by a virtual machine. To protect against MAC impersonation this option will be set to reject, ensuring the virtual switch does not honor requests to change the effective MAC address to anything other than the initial MAC address. Setting this to reject disables the port that the virtual network adapter used to send the request.

Navigate to the OpenSSL directory (c:\\openssl\\bin\\) on the VirtualCenter Server.\n3. Generate the RSA key for the server and the certificate signing request (CSR):\nopenssl req -new -out filename.csr \n\nWhen prompted enter the following: (Do not type the quotations)\n\nFor Country Name, type “US”\nFor State or Province Name, type “.”\nFor Locality Name, type “.”\nFor Organization Name, type “U.S. Government”\nFor Organizational Unit Name, type “OU=DISA, OU=PKI, OU=DoD”\nFor Common Name, type your Fully Qualified Domain Name of your server (i.e. server.disa.mil)\nFor Email Address, type your email address\n\n4.  The output from this command will yield two files: filename.csr and privkey.pem \n5. Upload/Copy the filename.csr to the Regular SSL Server Enrollment Form for the DoD PKI site.  You may use either of the two sites below.\n\nNote: These Certificate Authorities may have been decommissioned since the release of the checklist. If so, please use the most current Certificate Authority for enrolling your certificate request.\n\nCA-17 URL - https://ca-17.c3pki.chamb.disa.mil/ca\nCA-18 URL - https://ca-18.c3pki.den.disa.mil/ca\n\n6. You will be emailed that your certificate is ready and you will retrieve your signed certificate from the CA.\n7. In addition, you must create a PFX-formatted certificate file specific for Windows. The filename.pfx file is a concatenation of the server’s certificate and private key, exported in the PFX format; this file is then copied to the sub-directory on the VirtualCenter Server. \nPerform the following command:  (filename is the name of your certificate file)\n\nC:\\openssl\\bin\\Openssl pkcs12 –export in filename.crt –inkey privkey.pem –name filename –passout pass:testpassword –out filename.pfx\n\n8. Put the new signed certificate, private key, and filename.pfx in the C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application Data\\VMware\\VMware\nVirtualCenter\\SSL\\ directory.  Move the old certificates from the directory and put them somewhere safe for backup purposes."},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target VMware VirtualCenter"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-17720r1_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-17020","rid":"SV-18021r1_rule","stig_id":"ESX0725","gtitle":"VirtualCenter does not use DoD approved certs.","fix_id":"F-16829r1_fix","documentable":null,"responsibility":["System Administrator","Information Assurance Officer","[Virtual Server Administrator]"]}},{"id":"SV-83303","code":"control 'SV-83303' do\n  title 'VMware ESX management software that is no longer supported by the vendor for security updates must not be installed on a system.'\n  desc 'VMware ESX operating systems, virtual machines, and associated management software that are no longer supported by VMware for security updates are not evaluated or updated for vulnerabilities leaving them open to potential attack.

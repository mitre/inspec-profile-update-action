DAC models have the potential for the access controls to propagate without limit, resulting in unauthorized access to objects.\n\nWhen applications provide a DAC mechanism, the DNS implementation must be able to limit the propagation of those access rights.","descriptions":{"default":"Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is based on the premise that individual users are \"owners\" of objects and therefore have discretion over who should be authorized to access the object and in which mode (e.g., read or write). Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object or via specified ownership assignment. In a DNS implementation, DAC should be granted to a minimal number of individuals and objects because DNS does not interact directly with users and users do not store and share data with the DNS application directly.\n\nThe primary objective of DNS authentication and access control is the integrity of DNS records; only authorized personnel must be able to create and modify resource records, and name servers should only accept updates from authoritative primary servers for the relevant zones. Integrity is best ensured through authentication and access control features within the name server software and the file system the name server resides on. To protect the zone files and configuration data, which should only be accessed by the name service or an administrator, access controls must be implemented on files, and rights should not be easily propagated to other users. Lack of a stringent access control policy places the DNS infrastructure at risk to malicious persons and attackers and creates the potential for a denial of service to network resources.\n\nDAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes user-controlled file permissions. DAC models have the potential for the access controls to propagate without limit, resulting in unauthorized access to objects.\n\nWhen applications provide a DAC mechanism, the DNS implementation must be able to limit the propagation of those access rights.","check":"For an Active Directory (AD)-integrated DNS implementation, this is not applicable by virtue of being compliant with the Windows 2022 AD STIG because DNS data within an AD-integrated zone is kept within the Active Directory.\n\nFor a file-based Windows DNS implementation, log on to the DNS server using the Domain Admin or Enterprise Admin account or Local Administrator account.\n\nPress the Windows key + R and execute \"dnsmgmt.msc\".\n\nOn the opened DNS Manager snap-in from the left pane, expand the server name for the DNS server and then expand \"Forward Lookup Zones\".\n\nFrom the expanded list, click to select each zone.\n\nRight-click each zone and select \"Properties\".\n\nSelect the \"Security\" tab.\n\nReview the permissions applied to the zone.

When dealing with access restrictions pertaining to change control, any changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of the information system and/or application can have significant effects on the overall security of the system. Accordingly, only qualified and authorized individuals should be allowed to obtain access to application components for the purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.\n\nLogical access restrictions include, for example, controls that restrict access to workflow automation, media libraries, abstract layers (e.g., changes implemented into third-party interfaces rather than directly into information systems), and change windows (e.g., changes occur only during specified times, making unauthorized changes easy to discover).\n\nIf the name server software is run as a privileged user (e.g., root in Unix systems), any break-in into the software can have disastrous consequences in terms of resources resident in the name server platform. Specifically, a hacker who breaks into the software acquires unrestricted access and therefore can execute any commands or modify or delete any files. It is necessary to run the name server software as a nonprivileged user with access restricted to specified directories to contain damages resulting from break-in.","check":"Review the account under which the DNS software is running and determine the permissions that account has been assigned.\n\nIf the account under which the DNS software is running has not been restricted to the least privileged permissions required for the purpose of running the software, this is a finding.","fix":"Configure the permissions of the account being used to run the DNS software to have the least privileges required to run the DNS software."},"impact":0.5,"refs":[],"tags":{"check_id":"C-WDNS-22-000102_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"WDNS-22-000102","rid":"WDNS-22-000102_rule","stig_id":"WDNS-22-000102","gtitle":"SRG-APP-000516-DNS-000105","fix_id":"F-WDNS-22-000102_fix","documentable":null,"cci":["CCI-000366"],"nist":["CM-6 b"]}},{"id":"WDNS-22-000107_rule","code":"control 'WDNS-22-000107_rule' do\n  title 'The private keys corresponding to both the zone signing key (ZSK) and the key signing key (KSK) must not be kept on the DNSSEC-aware primary authoritative name server when the name server does not support dynamic updates.'\n  desc 'The private keys in the KSK and ZSK key pairs must be protected from unauthorized access.

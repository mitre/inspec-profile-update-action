DHCP snooping allows switches on the network to trust the port a DHCP server is connected to and not trust the other ports.\n\nThe DHCP snooping feature validates DHCP messages received from untrusted sources and filters out invalid messages as well as rate-limits DHCP traffic from trusted and untrusted sources. DHCP snooping feature builds and maintains a binding database, which contains information about untrusted hosts with leased IP addresses, and it utilizes the database to validate subsequent requests from untrusted hosts. Other security features, such as IP Source Guard and Dynamic Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Inspection (DAI), also use information stored in the DHCP snooping binding database. Hence, it is imperative that the DHCP snooping feature is enabled on all VLANs.","check":"Review the switch configuration and verify that DHCP snooping is enabled on all user VLANs. \n\nIf the switch does not have DHCP snooping enabled for all user VLANs to validate DHCP messages from untrusted sources, this is a finding.","fix":"Configure the switch to have DHCP snooping for all user VLANs to validate DHCP messages from untrusted sources."},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target Layer 2 Switch"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-6916r298404_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-206658","rid":"SV-206658r383575_rule","stig_id":"SRG-NET-000362-L2S-000025","gtitle":"SRG-NET-000362","fix_id":"F-6916r298405_fix","documentable":null,"legacy":["SV-76671","V-62181"],"cci":["CCI-002385"],"nist":["SC-5 a"]}},{"id":"SV-206659","code":"control 'SV-206659' do\n  title 'The layer 2 switch must have IP Source Guard enabled on all user-facing or untrusted access switch ports.'\n  desc \"IP Source Guard provides source IP address filtering on a Layer 2 port to prevent a malicious host from impersonating a legitimate host by assuming the legitimate host's IP address.

Knowing the victim’s MAC address and with the victim attached to a different switch belonging to the same trunk group, thereby requiring the trunk link and frame tagging, the malicious user can begin the attack by sending frames with two sets of tags. The outer tag that will have the attacker’s VLAN ID (probably the well-known and omnipresent default VLAN) is stripped off by the switch, and the inner tag that will have the victim’s VLAN ID is used by the switch as the next hop and sent out the trunk port.","check":"Review the switch configurations and examine all access switch ports.

For example: certsvr1.pem, certsvr2.pem.\n\n8. Create a single file for all of the server certificates on the client machine, by running the following command from the OS CLI. For example:\ncat /etc/stunnel/certsvr1.pem /etc/stunnel/certsvr2.pem > /etc/stunnel/servercerts.pem\n\n9. Configure stunnel for the connection to RS by using the steps below:\n\n10.

Copy the contents of the client certificate from cert.pem and enter them in the SSL Client Authentication field, in the RS UI, of the database to be secured. When done, be sure to save the change.\n\n14. Start the stunnel service by running the following command: service stunnel restart\n\nNote: Any change made to the stunnel configuration requires restarting the stunnel service.\n\n15. Check the stunnel log file to verify that the connection is working properly. The log file is created under the root folder within the configuration mentioned above.\n\n16.

This file can later be replayed to recover from a crash.\n\nTo ensure data availability, Redis Enterprise Software must be implemented in, at a minimum, a three-node cluster. A three-node cluster can withstand one node failure without data loss. If more than one node is lost in a three-node cluster and persistence is not enabled, then data loss is to be expected.\n\nThe Append Only File is a persistence mode that provides much better durability. For instance, using the default data fsync policy, Redis can lose just one second of writes in a dramatic event like a server power outage, or a single write if something goes wrong with the Redis process itself, but the operating system is still running correctly. AOF and RDB persistence can be enabled at the same time without problems. If the AOF is enabled on startup Redis will load the AOF, that is the file with the better durability guarantees.

These certificates can be replaced with another certificate, preferably a certificate issued by an intermediate certificate authority (CA).\n\nConfiguration of the database:\nTo encrypt the connection to the database endpoint with TLS, enter the contents the client certificate to the TLS field.\nNote: Once TLS encryption is enabled for the database endpoint, the database does not accept unsecured connections. TLS encryption can significantly impact database throughput and latency.\n\nAdding TLS CA signed certificates to the proxy:\nThe proxy is responsible for terminating the TLS connection.\nServer certificate and key are located on /etc/opt/redislabs:proxy_cert.pem - server certificate thatproxy_key.pem - server certificate key*any update on these requires a proxy restart\n\nEnabling of TLS is done via the \"ssl authentication\" field in the UI. It is a requirement to add a client-side certificate as a TLS connection via client certificate authentication (not just server-side authentication).\n\nInstalling CA signed certificates:\nReplace the RS server certificates and key on all nodes with the CA signed certificate and restart the proxy.\nNote: A certificate for the databases' endpoint should be assigned for the same domain as the cluster name. For example, for a cluster with the name \"redislabs.com\" the certificate should be for \"*.redislabs.com\".\n\nAdd the TLS client certificates in the UI including CA certificates and any intermediate certificates by chaining the certificate into one file (use a cat command to chain the certificates).\nOn the client side make sure to import and trust the CA and intermediate certificates (chain the CA certificate with intermediate as one file to use and import).\n\nClient configuration:\nTo connect to a database configured with TLS encryption, either use one of the Redis clients that inherently support SSL encryption, or use any Redis client and create a secured tunnel between the client machine and the RS nodes.\n\nTo create a secure tunnel between the client machine and the RS nodes, use tools that enable this functionality, such as spiped or stunnel. An example of how to use stunnel is detailed below.\nNote: For security reasons, RS supports only the TLS protocol. Therefore, make sure that the Redis client or secured tunnel solution used supports TLS, preferably TLS v1.2.\n\nWhen using self-signed certificates on the cluster nodes, make sure to copy these certificates to the client machines as well, thereby enabling the client to validate the cluster nodes.\n\nWhen using a certificate issued by an intermediate certificate authority (CA) on the cluster nodes, make sure that the CA root certificate is installed on the client machines.\n\nExample of how to secure client connection with TLS using stunnel: \nThe instructions below explain how to use stunnel for setting up a secure tunnel between a client machine and the RS nodes when the client is running on Ubuntu, using the default RS nodes' self-signed certificates, and a self-signed certificate on the client machine.\n\n1. Install stunnel version 5 or higher on the client machine. Older versions of stunnel do not support the TLS protocol.\n\n2. Create a self-signed certificate on the client machine:\n\n3. Generate a private key by running the following commands:\nsudo su\nopenssl genrsa -out /etc/stunnel/keyclient.pem 4096\n\n4. Generate a client certificate by running the following commands:\nopenssl req -new -x509 -key /etc/stunnel/keyclient.pem\n-out\n/etc/stunnel/cert.pem -days 1826\n\n5. When prompted, enter the appropriate configuration details for the certificate.\n\n6. Copy the RS node certificates from all nodes to the client machine. The certificates are saved in a file named proxy_cert.pem, which is stored in /etc/opt/redislabs in each node.\n\n7. Rename the certificate files fetched from the RS nodes as certsvr.pem. For example: certsvr1.pem, certsvr2.pem.\n\n8. Create a single file for all of the server certificates on the client machine by running the following command from the OS CLI. For example: cat /etc/stunnel/certsvr1.pem /etc/stunnel/certsvr2.pem > /etc/stunnel/servercerts.pem\n\n9. Configure stunnel for the connection to RS by using the steps below:\n\n10. Create a redislabs.conf file in /etc/stunnel folder.\n\n11. Make sure that the certificates that have been generated exist in the following folder: /etc/stunnel.\n\n12. Edit the redislabs.conf content to look as follows:cert = /etc/stunnel/cert.pem key = /etc/stunnel/keyclient.pem cafile = /etc/stunnel/servercerts.pem verify = 2 delay = yes output = /tmp/stunnel.log pid = /tmp/stunnel.pid[redislabs] client = yes accept = [server IP address]:[configured port] connect = [database endpoint value] Where [database endpoint value] is the database endpoint as can be retrieved from RS.\n\nNote: The value for the accept parameter is the local IP and port that is used for redirecting the traffic through the secure tunnel to the database endpoint configured in the connect parameter.\n\n13. Copy the contents of the client certificate from cert.pem and enter them in the SSL Client Authentication field, in the RS UI, of the database to be secured. When done, be sure to save the change.\n\n14. Start the stunnel service by running the following command: service stunnel restart\n\nNote: Any change made to the stunnel configuration requires restarting the stunnel service.\n\n15. Check the stunnel log file to verify that the connection is working properly. The log file is created under the root folder within the configuration mentioned above.\n\n16. Test the connection to the Redis database from the client machine. Use redis-cli to run commands on the client machine, and the commands are redirected from the local machine's port [configured port] to the RS database endpoint. Note that the connection to the Redis database is done through the local port; do not try to connect directly to the database endpoint.\n\nTLS version information:\nTo set the minimum TLS version that can be used for encrypting the data in transit between a Redis client and a Redis Enterprise cluster, use the REST API or the following rladmin command:\nrladmin> cluster config min_data_TLS_version [version, e.g., 1.2]\n\nNote that if a client supports an older TLS version, the communication is not be allowed.)\n  impact 0.5\n  ref 'DPMS Target Redis Enterprise 6.x'\n  tag check_id: 'C-54684r863376_chk'\n  tag severity: 'medium'\n  tag gid: 'V-251249'\n  tag rid: 'SV-251249r863377_rule'\n  tag stig_id: 'RD6X-00-011700'\n  tag gtitle: 'SRG-APP-000442-DB-000379'\n  tag fix_id: 'F-54638r804936_fix'\n  tag 'documentable'\n  tag cci: ['CCI-002422']\n  tag nist: ['SC-8 (2)']\nend","source_location":{"line":1,"ref":"U_Redis_Enterprise_6-x_STIG_V1R2/controls/SV-251249.rb"},"title":"Redis Enterprise DBMS must maintain the confidentiality and integrity of information during reception.","desc":"Information can be either unintentionally or maliciously disclosed or modified during reception, including, for example, during aggregation, at protocol transformation points, and during packing/unpacking.

To upgrade the Redis Enterprise Software (RS) software on a cluster, upgrade each of the nodes and then upgrade each of the databases in the cluster.\n\n- To upgrade the cluster to v6.0, the cluster must first be on 5.4.0 or above and the databases must be running Redis 5.\n- To upgrade the cluster to v5.6, the cluster must first be on 5.0.2-30 or above.\n- To upgrade the cluster to v5.4, the cluster must first be on 5.0 or above.\n- To upgrade the cluster to v5.2, the cluster must first be on 4.5 or above.\n\nThe upgrade process for a Redis Enterprise Software cluster is \"ongoing\" when the nodes in the cluster have mixed versions. The upgrade is only considered complete when all of the nodes are upgraded to the new version.\n\nWARNING Using features from the newer version before all nodes are upgraded can produce unexpected results or cause failures in the cluster.\n\nUpgrading a node: \nUpgrading the software on a node requires installing the RS installation package on all of the machines on which RS is installed.\n\nWARNING: The master node must be upgraded before upgrading the other nodes. It is recommended to keep all nodes up until the upgrade is completed on all nodes. The node role is shown in the output of the rladmin status nodes command. The installation path and user cannot be changed during upgrade. Node upgrade fails if the SSL certificates were configured in version 5.0.2 or above by manually updating the certificates on the disk instead of updating them through the API. For assistance with this issue, contact Support.\n\nRun install.sh from the directory where the media was untarred just like what is done for a new installation. The software recognizes this is an upgrade and proceeds accordingly.\n\nAs with a new installation, user must sudo or be root to do the upgrade.\n\nTo upgrade a node, run:\nsudo ./install.sh\n\nThe node upgrade process restarts the services running RS, which causes a short interruption to connections to the proxy, node, and databases.\n\nWARNING: To ensure cluster and databases' availability, it is important to upgrade the nodes one by one, and not attempt to upgrade more than one node at a time. To make sure that the node is functioning properly, run rlcheck and rladmin status extra all on the node both before and after the upgrade.\n\nIf the RS management UI is open in the browser while upgrading the nodes, make sure to refresh the browser before trying to work with the UI again.\n\nUpgrading a database \nSome RS upgrades add support for new Redis versions. In these cases, Redis Labs recommends upgrading the databases to the new Redis version, although this is not mandatory because RS upgrades are backward compatible. RS also supports a mix of Redis database versions.\n\nRS always supports two Redis versions. By default, new Redis databases are created with the latest version, and existing databases get upgraded to the latest version according to the instructions detailed below. If there is a desire to change the default Redis version to the previous version supported, it is recommended to use the tune cluster default_redis_version command in the rladmin CLI and set it to the previous Redis version supported.\n\nTo determine whether the Redis database versions match the latest Redis version supported by RS:\nIn the rladmin CLI, run the status command. If the Redis version is not the latest supported, an indication appears in the command output next to the database's status.\n\nIn the Management UI, Navigate to the Cluster >> Configuration page. The page lists the latest Redis version supported.\n\nIf the Redis database versions are older than the version supported by RS, Redis Labs recommends upgrading the Redis databases.\n\nTo upgrade the database:\n- Ensure that all of the nodes in the RS cluster are upgraded. Databases cannot be upgraded before all of the nodes in the cluster are upgraded.\n- In the rladmin CLI on any node in the cluster, run this command for each database: \nrladmin upgrade db <database_name | database_ID>\n\nDuring the database upgrade process, the database is restarted. As a result:\nFor databases that have replication enabled, a failover is done before the master database restarts to make sure that there is no downtime.\n\nFor databases without replication but with persistence enabled, the database is unavailable during the restart because data is restored from the persistence file. The length of the downtime is different for each persistence option. For example, AOF usually takes longer than an RDB file.\n\nFor databases that have neither replication nor persistence enabled, the database loses all its data after it is restarted.\n\nUpgrading Active-Active databases \nWhen upgrading an Active-Active (CRDB) database, the following may also be upgraded:\n\nProtocol version - RS 5.4.2 and higher include a new CRDB protocol version to support new Active-Active features. The CRDB protocol is backward-compatible so that RS 5.4.2 CRDB instances can understand write-operations that come from instances with the older CRDB protocol, but CRDB instances with the older protocol cannot understand write-operations of instances with the newer protocol version. As a result, after upgrading the CRDB protocol on one instance, instances that were not upgraded yet cannot receive write updates from the upgraded instance. The upgraded instance receives updates from upgraded and non-upgraded instances.\n\nNote: Upgrade all instances of a specific CRDB within a reasonable time frame to avoid temporary inconsistencies between the instances. Make sure that  all instances of a specific CRDB are upgraded before performing global operations on the CRDB, such as removing instances and adding new instances.\n\nAfter upgrading an instance to use the new protocol version, it automatically receives any missing write-operations.\n\nFeature set version: RS 5.6.0 and higher include a new feature set version to support new Active-Active features. When updating the feature set version for an Active-Active database, the feature set version is updated for all of the database instances.\n\nTo upgrade a CRDB instance:\nUpgrade RS on each node in the clusters where the CRDB instances are located.\n\nTo confirm the status of the CRDB instances, run: rladmin status\n\nThe statuses of the CRDB instances on the node can indicate:\nOLD REDIS VERSION\nOLD CRDB PROTOCOL VERSION\nOLD CRDB FEATURESET VERSION\ncrdb-upgrade-node\n\nTo upgrade each CRDB instance including the Redis version and CRDB protocol version, run:\nrladmin upgrade db <database_name | database_ID>\n\nIf the protocol version is old, read the warning message carefully and confirm. crdb-upgrade-protocol\n\nThe CRDB instance uses the new Redis version and CRDB protocol version.\n\nTo upgrade the CRDB instance without upgrading the protocol version:\nIf the feature set version is old, all of the CRDB instances must be upgraded. Then, to update the feature set for each active-active database, run:\ncrdb-cli crdb update --crdb-guid <CRDB-GUID> --featureset-version yes\n\nRetrieve the <CRDB-GUID> with the following command:\ncrdb-cli crdb list\n\nLook for the fully qualified domain name (CLUSTER-FDQN) of the cluster and use the associated GUID.)\n  impact 0.5\n  ref 'DPMS Target Redis Enterprise 6.x'\n  tag check_id: 'C-54688r804947_chk'\n  tag severity: 'medium'\n  tag gid: 'V-251253'\n  tag rid: 'SV-251253r855626_rule'\n  tag stig_id: 'RD6X-00-012500'\n  tag gtitle: 'SRG-APP-000456-DB-000390'\n  tag fix_id: 'F-54642r804948_fix'\n  tag 'documentable'\n  tag cci: ['CCI-002605']\n  tag nist: ['SI-2 c']\nend","source_location":{"line":1,"ref":"U_Redis_Enterprise_6-x_STIG_V1R2/controls/SV-251253.rb"},"title":"Security-relevant software updates to Redis Enterprise DBMS must be installed within the time period directed by an authoritative source (e.g., IAVM, CTOs, DTMs, and STIGs).","desc":"Security flaws with software applications, including database management systems, are discovered daily.

Compare to current Redis Enterprise version available.\n\nIf the organization is not following their own defined time periods to apply updates, this is a finding.","fix":"To update to the current version of the software, perform the following steps listed from the Redis Labs Enterprise site. To upgrade the Redis Enterprise Software (RS) software on a cluster, upgrade each of the nodes and then upgrade each of the databases in the cluster.\n\n- To upgrade the cluster to v6.0, the cluster must first be on 5.4.0 or above and the databases must be running Redis 5.\n- To upgrade the cluster to v5.6, the cluster must first be on 5.0.2-30 or above.\n- To upgrade the cluster to v5.4, the cluster must first be on 5.0 or above.\n- To upgrade the cluster to v5.2, the cluster must first be on 4.5 or above.\n\nThe upgrade process for a Redis Enterprise Software cluster is \"ongoing\" when the nodes in the cluster have mixed versions. The upgrade is only considered complete when all of the nodes are upgraded to the new version.\n\nWARNING Using features from the newer version before all nodes are upgraded can produce unexpected results or cause failures in the cluster.\n\nUpgrading a node: \nUpgrading the software on a node requires installing the RS installation package on all of the machines on which RS is installed.\n\nWARNING: The master node must be upgraded before upgrading the other nodes. It is recommended to keep all nodes up until the upgrade is completed on all nodes. The node role is shown in the output of the rladmin status nodes command. The installation path and user cannot be changed during upgrade. Node upgrade fails if the SSL certificates were configured in version 5.0.2 or above by manually updating the certificates on the disk instead of updating them through the API. For assistance with this issue, contact Support.\n\nRun install.sh from the directory where the media was untarred just like what is done for a new installation. The software recognizes this is an upgrade and proceeds accordingly.\n\nAs with a new installation, user must sudo or be root to do the upgrade.\n\nTo upgrade a node, run:\nsudo ./install.sh\n\nThe node upgrade process restarts the services running RS, which causes a short interruption to connections to the proxy, node, and databases.\n\nWARNING: To ensure cluster and databases' availability, it is important to upgrade the nodes one by one, and not attempt to upgrade more than one node at a time. To make sure that the node is functioning properly, run rlcheck and rladmin status extra all on the node both before and after the upgrade.\n\nIf the RS management UI is open in the browser while upgrading the nodes, make sure to refresh the browser before trying to work with the UI again.\n\nUpgrading a database \nSome RS upgrades add support for new Redis versions. In these cases, Redis Labs recommends upgrading the databases to the new Redis version, although this is not mandatory because RS upgrades are backward compatible. RS also supports a mix of Redis database versions.\n\nRS always supports two Redis versions. By default, new Redis databases are created with the latest version, and existing databases get upgraded to the latest version according to the instructions detailed below. If there is a desire to change the default Redis version to the previous version supported, it is recommended to use the tune cluster default_redis_version command in the rladmin CLI and set it to the previous Redis version supported.\n\nTo determine whether the Redis database versions match the latest Redis version supported by RS:\nIn the rladmin CLI, run the status command. If the Redis version is not the latest supported, an indication appears in the command output next to the database's status.\n\nIn the Management UI, Navigate to the Cluster >> Configuration page. The page lists the latest Redis version supported.\n\nIf the Redis database versions are older than the version supported by RS, Redis Labs recommends upgrading the Redis databases.\n\nTo upgrade the database:\n- Ensure that all of the nodes in the RS cluster are upgraded. Databases cannot be upgraded before all of the nodes in the cluster are upgraded.\n- In the rladmin CLI on any node in the cluster, run this command for each database: \nrladmin upgrade db <database_name | database_ID>\n\nDuring the database upgrade process, the database is restarted. As a result:\nFor databases that have replication enabled, a failover is done before the master database restarts to make sure that there is no downtime.\n\nFor databases without replication but with persistence enabled, the database is unavailable during the restart because data is restored from the persistence file. The length of the downtime is different for each persistence option. For example, AOF usually takes longer than an RDB file.\n\nFor databases that have neither replication nor persistence enabled, the database loses all its data after it is restarted.\n\nUpgrading Active-Active databases \nWhen upgrading an Active-Active (CRDB) database, the following may also be upgraded:\n\nProtocol version - RS 5.4.2 and higher include a new CRDB protocol version to support new Active-Active features. The CRDB protocol is backward-compatible so that RS 5.4.2 CRDB instances can understand write-operations that come from instances with the older CRDB protocol, but CRDB instances with the older protocol cannot understand write-operations of instances with the newer protocol version. As a result, after upgrading the CRDB protocol on one instance, instances that were not upgraded yet cannot receive write updates from the upgraded instance. The upgraded instance receives updates from upgraded and non-upgraded instances.\n\nNote: Upgrade all instances of a specific CRDB within a reasonable time frame to avoid temporary inconsistencies between the instances. Make sure that  all instances of a specific CRDB are upgraded before performing global operations on the CRDB, such as removing instances and adding new instances.\n\nAfter upgrading an instance to use the new protocol version, it automatically receives any missing write-operations.\n\nFeature set version: RS 5.6.0 and higher include a new feature set version to support new Active-Active features. When updating the feature set version for an Active-Active database, the feature set version is updated for all of the database instances.\n\nTo upgrade a CRDB instance:\nUpgrade RS on each node in the clusters where the CRDB instances are located.\n\nTo confirm the status of the CRDB instances, run: rladmin status\n\nThe statuses of the CRDB instances on the node can indicate:\nOLD REDIS VERSION\nOLD CRDB PROTOCOL VERSION\nOLD CRDB FEATURESET VERSION\ncrdb-upgrade-node\n\nTo upgrade each CRDB instance including the Redis version and CRDB protocol version, run:\nrladmin upgrade db <database_name | database_ID>\n\nIf the protocol version is old, read the warning message carefully and confirm. crdb-upgrade-protocol\n\nThe CRDB instance uses the new Redis version and CRDB protocol version.\n\nTo upgrade the CRDB instance without upgrading the protocol version:\nIf the feature set version is old, all of the CRDB instances must be upgraded. Then, to update the feature set for each active-active database, run:\ncrdb-cli crdb update --crdb-guid <CRDB-GUID> --featureset-version yes\n\nRetrieve the <CRDB-GUID> with the following command:\ncrdb-cli crdb list\n\nLook for the fully qualified domain name (CLUSTER-FDQN) of the cluster and use the associated GUID."},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target Redis Enterprise 6.x"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-54688r804947_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-251253","rid":"SV-251253r855626_rule","stig_id":"RD6X-00-012500","gtitle":"SRG-APP-000456-DB-000390","fix_id":"F-54642r804948_fix","documentable":null,"cci":["CCI-002605"],"nist":["SI-2 c"]}},{"id":"SV-251426","code":"control 'SV-251426' do\n  title 'Redis Enterprise DBMS must generate audit records for DoD-defined auditable events within all DBMS/database components.'\n  desc 'Redis Enterprise does not generate all the DoD-required audit records.\n\nThis could lead to incomplete information as follows:\n- Without an audit trail, unauthorized access to protected data and attempts to elevate or restrict privileges could go undetected. \n- It would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.\n- Without the creation of certain audit logs, it would be difficult to identify attempted attacks, and an audit trail would not be available for some forensic investigation for after-the-fact actions. \n\nFor a complete list of unsupported audit requirements, email \"disa.letterkenny.re.mbx.stig-customer-support-mailbox@mail.mil\".

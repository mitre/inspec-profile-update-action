Bidirectional authentication provides stronger safeguards to validate the identity of other devices for connections that are of greater risk.\n\nBidirectional authentication solutions include, but are not limited to, IEEE 802.1x and Extensible Authentication Protocol [EAP], RADIUS server with EAP-Transport Layer Security [TLS] authentication, Kerberos, and SSL mutual authentication.\n\nA local connection is any connection with a device communicating without the use of a network. A network connection is any connection with a device that communicates through a network (e.g., local area network, wide area network, or the Internet). A remote connection is any connection with a device communicating through an external network (e.g., the Internet).\n\nBecause of the challenges of applying this requirement on a large scale, organizations are encouraged to only apply this requirement to those limited number (and type) of devices that truly need to support this capability.","check":"For systems where Wi-Fi is not approved for use, run the following command to disable the Wi-Fi service:\n\nTo list the network devices that are enabled on the system, run the following command:\n\n/usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/networksetup -listallnetworkservices\n\nIf the Wi-Fi service name is not preceded by an asterisk(*), this is a finding.","fix":"To disable a network device, run the following command:\n\n/usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/networksetup -setnetworkserviceenabled Wi-Fi off"},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target Apple OS X 10.14"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-9884r282381_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-209633","rid":"SV-209633r610285_rule","stig_id":"AOSX-14-004020","gtitle":"SRG-OS-000379-GPOS-00164","fix_id":"F-9884r282382_fix","documentable":null,"legacy":["SV-104731","V-95585"],"cci":["CCI-001967"],"nist":["IA-3 (1)"]}},{"id":"SV-209634","code":"control 'SV-209634' do\n  title 'The macOS system must be configured with the sudoers file configured to authenticate users on a per -tty basis.'\n  desc %q(The \"sudo\" command must be configured to prompt for the administrator's password at least once in each newly opened Terminal window or remote logon session, as this prevents a malicious user from taking advantage of an unlocked computer or an abandoned logon session to bypass the normal password prompt requirement. \n\nWithout the \"tty_tickets\" option, all open local and remote logon sessions would be authenticated to use sudo without a password for the duration of the configured password timeout window.)\n  desc 'check', 'To check if the \"tty_tickets\" option is set for \"/usr/bin/sudo\", run the following command:\n\n/usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/grep tty_tickets /etc/sudoers\n\nIf there is no result, this is a finding.'\n  desc 'fix', 'Edit the \"/etc/sudoers\" file to contain the line:\n\nDefaults tty_tickets\n\nThis line can be placed in the defaults section or at the end of the file.'\n  impact 0.7\n  ref 'DPMS Target Apple OS X 10.14'\n  tag check_id: 'C-9885r282384_chk'\n  tag severity: 'high'\n  tag gid: 'V-209634'\n  tag rid: 'SV-209634r610285_rule'\n  tag stig_id: 'AOSX-14-004021'\n  tag gtitle: 'SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227'\n  tag fix_id: 'F-9885r282385_fix'\n  tag 'documentable'\n  tag legacy: ['SV-104733', 'V-95587']\n  tag cci: ['CCI-000366']\n  tag nist: ['CM-6 b']\nend","source_location":{"line":1,"ref":"../inspec_stubs/U_Apple_OS_X_10-14_STIG_V2R6/controls/SV-209634.rb"},"title":"The macOS system must be configured with the sudoers file configured to authenticate users on a per -tty basis.","desc":"The \"sudo\" command must be configured to prompt for the administrator's password at least once in each newly opened Terminal window or remote logon session, as this prevents a malicious user from taking advantage of an unlocked computer or an abandoned logon session to bypass the normal password prompt requirement. \n\nWithout the \"tty_tickets\" option, all open local and remote logon sessions would be authenticated to use sudo without a password for the duration of the configured password timeout window.","descriptions":{"default":"The \"sudo\" command must be configured to prompt for the administrator's password at least once in each newly opened Terminal window or remote logon session, as this prevents a malicious user from taking advantage of an unlocked computer or an abandoned logon session to bypass the normal password prompt requirement. \n\nWithout the \"tty_tickets\" option, all open local and remote logon sessions would be authenticated to use sudo without a password for the duration of the configured password timeout window.","check":"To check if the \"tty_tickets\" option is set for \"/usr/bin/sudo\", run the following command:\n\n/usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/grep tty_tickets /etc/sudoers\n\nIf there is no result, this is a finding.","fix":"Edit the \"/etc/sudoers\" file to contain the line:\n\nDefaults tty_tickets\n\nThis line can be placed in the defaults section or at the end of the file."},"impact":0.7,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target Apple OS X 10.14"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-9885r282384_chk","severity":"high","gid":"V-209634","rid":"SV-209634r610285_rule","stig_id":"AOSX-14-004021","gtitle":"SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227","fix_id":"F-9885r282385_fix","documentable":null,"legacy":["SV-104733","V-95587"],"cci":["CCI-000366"],"nist":["CM-6 b"]}},{"id":"SV-209635","code":"control 'SV-209635' do\n  title 'The macOS system must enable System Integrity Protection.'\n  desc 'System Integrity Protection (SIP) is vital to the protection of the integrity of macOS.

If the wireless peripheral is only passing telemetry data, encryption of the data may not be required.","descriptions":{"default":"Without protection of communications with wireless peripherals, confidentiality and integrity may be compromised because unprotected communications can be intercepted and either read, altered, or used to compromise the operating system.\n\nThis requirement applies to wireless peripheral technologies (e.g., wireless mice, keyboards, displays, etc.) used with an operating system. Wireless peripherals (e.g., Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/IR keyboards, mice, and pointing devices and Near Field Communications [NFC]) present a unique challenge by creating an open, unsecured port on a computer. Wireless peripherals must meet DoD requirements for wireless data transmission and be approved for use by the AO. Even though some wireless peripherals such as mice and pointing devices do not ordinarily carry information that needs to be protected, modification of communications with these wireless peripherals may be used to compromise the operating system. Communication paths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification.\n\nProtecting the confidentiality and integrity of communications with wireless peripherals can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical barriers to wireless radio frequencies) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques). If physical means of protection are employed, then logical means (cryptography) do not have to be employed, and vice versa. If the wireless peripheral is only passing telemetry data, encryption of the data may not be required.","check":"If Bluetooth connectivity is required to facilitate use of approved external devices, this is not applicable.\n\nTo check if Bluetooth is disabled, run the following command:\n\n/usr/sbin/system_profiler SPConfigurationProfileDataType | /usr/bin/grep DisableBluetooth\n\nIf the return is null or is not \"DisableBluetooth = 1\", this is a finding.\n\nTo check if the system is configured to disable access to the Bluetooth preference pane and prevent it from being displayed, run the following command:\n\n/usr/sbin/system_profiler SPConfigurationProfileDataType | /usr/bin/grep -A 6 -E 'DisabledPreferencePanes|HiddenPreferencePanes'\n\nIf the return is not two arrays (HiddenPreferencePanes and DisabledPreferencePanes) each containing: “com.apple.preferences.Bluetooth”, this is a finding.","fix":"This setting is enforced using the \"Custom Policy\" and \"Restrictions Policy\" configuration profiles."},"impact":0.3,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target Apple OS X 10.14"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-56157r819046_chk","severity":"low","gid":"V-252701","rid":"SV-252701r819048_rule","stig_id":"AOSX-14-002054","gtitle":"SRG-OS-000481-GPOS-00481","fix_id":"F-56107r819047_fix","documentable":null,"cci":["CCI-002418"],"nist":["SC-8"]}},{"id":"SV-252707","code":"control 'SV-252707' do\n  title 'The macOS system must be a supported release.'\n  desc 'An operating system release is considered \"supported\" if the vendor continues to provide security patches for the product.

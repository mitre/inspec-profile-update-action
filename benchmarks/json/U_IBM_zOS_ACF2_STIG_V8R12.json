All other JOBCLASSes can specify a PROCLIB entry that uses the same PROCxx or any other PROCxx DD statement identified in the JES2 procedure or identified in the JES2 dynamic PROCLIB definitions.

The following is a list of actions that can be performed to accomplish this recommendation:\n\na. Ensure that MSTJCLxx contains only PROCLIB data sets that contain STC and TSO procedures.\nb. If an application PROCLIB data set is required for JES2, ensure that the JES2 procedure specifies more than one PROCxx DD statement concatenation or identified in the JES2 dynamic PROCLIB definitions. Identify one PROCxx DD statement data set concatenation that contains the STC and TSO PROCLIB data sets. Identify one or more additional PROCxx DD statements that can contain any other PROCLIB data sets. The concatenation of the additional PROCxx DD statements can contain the same data sets that are identified in the PROCxx DD statement for STC and TSO.

Ensure that the JES2 configuration file is changed to specify that the PROCLIB entry for the STC and TSU JOBCLASSes point to the proper PROCxx entry within the JES2 procedure or JES2 dynamic PROCLIB definitions that contain the STC and/or TSO procedures. All other JOBCLASSes can specify a PROCLIB entry that uses the same PROCxx or any other PROCxx DD statement identified in the JES2 procedure or identified in the JES2 dynamic PROCLIB definitions. The following is an example of the JES2 initialization parameters:\n\nJOBCLASS(*) ACCT=NO, /* ACCT # NOT REQUIRED (DEF.)*/ \n...\nPROCLIB=01, /* DEFAULT TO //PROC01 DD (DEF.)*/\n...\nJOBCLASS(STC) AUTH=ALL, /* ALLOW ALL COMMANDS (DEF.)*/ \n...\nPROCLIB=00, /* USE //PROC00 DD (DEF.)*/ \n...\nJOBCLASS(TSU) AUTH=ALL, /* ALLOW ALL COMMANDS (DEF.)*/\n...\nPROCLIB=00, /* USE //PROC00 DD (DEF.)*/ \n...\n\nd.

Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement.\n\nAccess control policies include: identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include: access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography.

However, uncertainty is reduced and security auditing is enhanced by explicitly specifying the locations of the files. In the TCP/IP started task's JCL, Data Definition (DD) statements can be used to specify the locations of the files. The PROFILE DD statement identifies the PROFILE.TCPIP file and the SYSTCPD DD statement identifies the TCPIP.DATA file.\n\nThe location of the TCPIP.DATA file can also be specified by coding the RESOLVER_CONFIG environment variable as a parameter of the ENVAR option in the TCP/IP started task's JCL.

It is also instrumental with ongoing network management functions that keep the routers and links available for providing network services. Any disruption to the RP or the control and management planes can result in mission-critical network outages.\n\nA DoS attack targeting the RE can result in excessive CPU and memory utilization. To maintain network stability and RP security, the router must be able to handle specific control plane and management plane traffic that is destined to the RE. In the past, one method of filtering was to use ingress filters on forwarding interfaces to filter both forwarding path and receiving path traffic. However, this method does not scale well as the number of interfaces grows and the size of the ingress filters grows. Control plane policing increases the security of routers and multilayer switches by protecting the RE from unnecessary or malicious traffic. Filtering and rate limiting the traffic flow of control plane packets can be implemented to protect routers against reconnaissance and DoS attacks, allowing the control plane to maintain packet

Hackers who initiate denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on routers commonly send large streams of packets with IP options. Dropping the packets with IP options reduces the load of IP options packets on the router. The end result is a reduction in the effects of the DoS attack on the router and on downstream routers.","check":"This requirement is not applicable for the DoDIN Backbone.\n\nReview the router configuration to determine if it will block all packets with IP options.\n\nfirewall {\n    family inet {\n        filter INBOUND_FILTER {\n            term DROP_IPOPTIONS {\n                from {\n                    ip-options any;\n                }\n                then {\n                    syslog;\n                    discard;\n                }\n            }\n            term BLOCK_BOGONS {\n                from {\n                    source-prefix-list {\n                        BOGON_PREFIXES;\n                    }\n                }\n                then {\n                    syslog;\n                    discard;\n                }\n            }\n            term ALLOW_ABC {\n            …\n            …\n            …\n            term DENY_ALL_OTHER {\n                then {\n                    log;\n                    syslog;\n                    reject;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\nIf the router is not configured to drop all packets with IP options, this is a finding.","fix":"This requirement is not applicable for the DoDIN Backbone.\n\nConfigure the router to drop all packets with IP options.\n\n[edit firewall family inet filter INBOUND_FILTER]\nset term DROP_IPOPTIONS from ip-options any\nset term DROP_IPOPTIONS then discard\ninsert term DROP_IPOPTIONS before  term BLOCK_BOGONS"},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target Juniper Router RTR"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-18269r296988_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-217040","rid":"SV-217040r604135_rule","stig_id":"JUNI-RT-000350","gtitle":"SRG-NET-000205-RTR-000015","fix_id":"F-18267r296989_fix","documentable":null,"legacy":["SV-101075","V-90865"],"cci":["CCI-002403"],"nist":["SC-7 (11)"]}},{"id":"SV-217041","code":"control 'SV-217041' do\n  title 'The Juniper perimeter router must be configured to have Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) disabled on all external interfaces.'\n  desc 'LLDPs are primarily used to obtain protocol addresses of neighboring devices and discover platform capabilities of those devices.

Packet loss can also occur if an LDP session closes and the router continues to forward traffic using the link associated with the LDP peer rather than an alternate pathway with a fully synchronized LDP session. The MPLS LDP-IGP Synchronization feature provides a means to synchronize LDP with OSPF or IS-IS to minimize MPLS packet loss.

Resembling a Layer 2 switch, the forwarding table instance is responsible for learning MAC addresses and providing loop-free forwarding of customer traffic to the appropriate end nodes. Each VPLS domain is identified by a globally unique VPN ID; hence, VFIs of the same VPLS domain must be configured with the same VPLS ID on all participating PE routers. To guarantee traffic separation for all customer VLANs and that all packets are forwarded to the correct destination, it is imperative that the correct attachment circuits are associated with the appropriate forwarding table instance and that each forwarding table instance is associated to the unique VPLS ID assigned to the customer VLAN.","check":"Review the implementation plan and the VPLS IDs assigned to customer VLANs for the VPLS deployment.\n\nReview the PE router configuration to verify that customer attachment circuits are associated to the appropriate routing instance configured for the customers VPLS ID.\n\ninterfaces {\n    ge-0/1/0.0 {\n        encapsulation ethernet-vpls;\n        unit 0 {\n        }\n    }\n…\n…\n…\nrouting-instances {\n    VPLS_CUST2 {\n        instance-type vpls;\n        interface ge-0/1/0.0;\n        route-distinguisher 22:22;\n        vrf-target target:22:22;\n        protocols {\n            vpls {\n                site-range 9;\n                no-tunnel-services;\n                site R8 {\n                    site-identifier 8;\n                    interface ge-0/1/0.0;\n                }\n                vpls-id 102;\n                neighbor 8.8.8.8;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nIf the attachment circuits have not been bound to appropriate routing instance configured with the assigned VPLS ID for each customer VLAN, this is a finding.","fix":"Assign globally unique VPLS ID to each VPLS routing instance as shown in the example.\n\n[edit routing-instances VPLS_CUST2 protocols vpls]\nset vpls-id 102 neighbor 8.8.8.8"},"impact":0.7,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target Juniper Router RTR"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-18301r297084_chk","severity":"high","gid":"V-217072","rid":"SV-217072r604135_rule","stig_id":"JUNI-RT-000660","gtitle":"SRG-NET-000512-RTR-000009","fix_id":"F-18299r297085_fix","documentable":null,"legacy":["SV-101135","V-90925"],"cci":["CCI-000366"],"nist":["CM-6 b"]}},{"id":"SV-217073","code":"control 'SV-217073' do\n  title 'The Juniper PE router providing Virtual Private LAN Services (VPLS) must be configured to have traffic storm control thresholds on CE-facing interfaces.'\n  desc 'A traffic storm occurs when packets flood a VPLS bridge, creating excessive traffic and degrading network performance.

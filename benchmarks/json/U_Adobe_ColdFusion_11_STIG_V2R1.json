The uninstall feature is meant to be used by an SA to maintain a secure and stable system.  In the event an attacker gains access to the uninstall functionality, he can then attempt to revert the system to an unsecure version which may have known and documented attacks that can be successful to compromise ColdFusion.  \n\nTo protect against this type of attack and to further define roles for users, access to the patch management functionality is important.  Proper protection is performed through assigning the appropriate roles to the users of the Administrator Console and through the least privileged permissions assigned at the OS level.","check":"Locate the hf-updates directory for ColdFusion.

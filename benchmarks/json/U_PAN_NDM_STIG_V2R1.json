Some of the functions and services provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations. Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single component (e.g., email and web services); however, doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component.\n\nTo support the requirements and principles of least functionality, the network device must support the organizational requirements providing only essential capabilities and limiting the use of ports, protocols, and/or services to only those required, authorized, and approved to conduct official business or to address authorized quality of life issues.\n\nThe Palo Alto Networks security platform uses a hardened operating system in which unnecessary services are not present.  The device has a DNS, NTP, update, and e-mail client installed.  Note that these are client applications and not servers; additionally, each has a valid purpose.

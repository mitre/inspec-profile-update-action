Failure to detect attacks that use unauthorized data mining techniques to attack applications may result in the compromise of information.\n\nInjection attacks allow an attacker to inject code into a program or query or inject malware onto a computer to execute remote commands that can read or modify a database, or change data on a website. These attacks include buffer overrun, XML, JavaScript, and HTML injections.\n\nIDPS component(s) with the capability to prevent code injections must be included in the IDPS implementation to protect against unauthorized data mining. These components must include rules and anomaly detection algorithms to monitor for atypical database queries or accesses.","check":"Go to  Objects >> Security Profiles >> Vulnerability Protection\n\nIf there are no Vulnerability Protection Profiles configured, this is a finding.\n\nAsk the Administrator which Vulnerability Protection Profile is used to protect application assets by blocking and alerting on attacks.\nView the configured Vulnerability Protection Profile; check the \"Severity\" and \"Action\" columns.\n\nIf the Vulnerability Protection Profile used for database protection does not block all critical, high, and medium threats, this is a finding.\n\nIf the Vulnerability Protection Profile used for database protection does not alert on low and informational threats, this is a finding.\n\nAsk the Administrator which Security Policy is used to protect application assets.\nGo to Policies >> Security\nView the configured Security Policy; view the \"Profile\" column.\n \nIf the \"Profile\" column does not display the Vulnerability Protection Profile symbol, this is a finding.\n\nMoving the cursor over the symbol will list the exact Vulnerability Protection Profiles applied.\n\nIf the specific Vulnerability Protection Profile is not listed, this is a finding.","fix":"Set a unique hostname.\nGo to Device >> Setup >> Management\nIn the \"General Settings\" window, select the \"Edit\" icon (the gear symbol in the upper-right corner of the pane).\nIn the \"General Settings\" window, in the \"hostname\" field; enter a unique hostname."},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target Palo Alto Networks IDPS"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-7955r358436_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-207701","rid":"SV-207701r557390_rule","stig_id":"PANW-IP-000033","gtitle":"SRG-NET-000318-IDPS-00182","fix_id":"F-7955r358437_fix","documentable":null,"legacy":["SV-77163","V-62673"],"cci":["CCI-002346"],"nist":["AC-23"]}},{"id":"SV-207702","code":"control 'SV-207702' do\n  title 'The Palo Alto Networks security platform must off-load log records to a centralized log server.'\n  desc 'Information stored in one location is vulnerable to accidental or incidental deletion or alteration.

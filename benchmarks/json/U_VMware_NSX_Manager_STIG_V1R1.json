These logs must be aggregated into a centralized server and can be used as part of the organization's security incident tracking and analysis.","check":"Verify NSX Manager logs are sent to a centralized server and can be used as part of the organization's security incident tracking and analysis.\n \nLog on to NSX Manager with credentials authorized for administration, navigate and select Manage Appliance Settings >> Syslog Server >> Edit.\n\nEnter name or IP of the Syslog Server, Port, and Protocol.\n\nIf logs are not sent to a centralized server, this is a finding.\n\nNote: TCP is the preferred protocol configuration to protect against network outages and queues logs locally until network connection is restored to a centralized server.","fix":"Change the logs in NSX Manager to send to a centralized server for use as part of the organization's security incident tracking and analysis.\n \nLogin to the NSX Manager Web Interface, using credentials authorized for administration.\n\nNavigate from the Home screen >> \"Manage Appliance Settings\" >> Settings >> General >> Syslog Server\n\nVerify a syslog server has been configured with the correct address, port, and protocol. \n\nLogin to the vCenter with the appropriate credentials for the Network and Security Platform >> Select \"Hosts and Clusters\" from the inventories panel >> Expand the entire drop-down section on the left panel >> Select a host as indicated by the ESX host icon >> Navigate to the \"Manage\" section on the newly updated right panel >> Select \"Settings\" >> \"System\" >> \"Advanced System Settings\" >> In the search field within \"Advanced System Settings\" enter \"Syslog.global.logHost\" and press enter >> Select the \"Syslog.global.logHost\" >> Click the pencil icon >> Insert the desired syslog aggregator or SIEM that exists in the customer environment."},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target VMware NSX 6 NDM"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-69657r1_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-69217","rid":"SV-83821r1_rule","stig_id":"VNSX-ND-000140","gtitle":"SRG-APP-000516-NDM-000342","fix_id":"F-75403r1_fix","documentable":null,"cci":["CCI-000366","CCI-000833"],"nist":["CM-6 b","IR-5 (1)"]}},{"id":"SV-83823","code":"control 'SV-83823' do\n  title 'The NSX vCenter must obtain its public key certificates from an appropriate certificate policy through an approved service provider.'\n  desc 'For user certificates, each organization obtains certificates from an approved, shared service provider, as required by OMB policy.

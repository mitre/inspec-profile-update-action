Kerberos tickets have a limited lifetime so the time an attacker has to implement an attack is limited.  This policy controls how long TGTs can be renewed.  With Kerberos, the user’s initial authentication to the domain controller results in a TGT which is then used to request Service Tickets to resources.  Upon startup, each computer gets a TGT before requesting a service ticket to the domain controller and any other computers it needs to access.  For services that startup under a specified user account, users must always get a TGT first, then get Service Tickets to all computers and services accessed.","check":"Verify the following is configured in the Default Domain Policy.\n\nOpen \"Group Policy Management\".\nNavigate to \"Group Policy Objects\" in the Domain being reviewed (Forest >> Domains >> Domain). \nRight click on the \"Default Domain Policy\", select \"Edit\".\nNavigate to Computer Configuration >> Policies >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Account Policies >> Kerberos Policy.\n\nIf the value for \"Maximum lifetime for user ticket\" is \"0\" or greater than \"10\" hours, this is a finding.","fix":"Configure the policy value in the Default Domain Policy for Computer Configuration >> Policies >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Account Policies >> Kerberos Policy >> \"Maximum lifetime for user ticket\" to a maximum of \"10\" hours, but not \"0\" which equates to \"Ticket doesn't expire\"."},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target Windows 2008"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-71093r1_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-2378","rid":"SV-28499r2_rule","stig_id":"AD.4031_2008","gtitle":"Kerberos - User Ticket Lifetime","fix_id":"F-76937r1_fix","documentable":null,"responsibility":"System Administrator","cci":["CCI-000366"],"nist":["CM-6 b"]}},{"id":"SV-28501","code":"control 'SV-28501' do\n  title 'The Kerberos user ticket renewal maximum lifetime must be limited to 7 days or less.'\n  desc \"This setting determines the period of time (in days) during which a user's Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) may be renewed.

However, an attacker might compromise the VM by making use of this introspection channel; therefore it should be monitored for unauthorized usage of this API. A VM must be configured explicitly to accept access by the VMsafe CPU/memory API. This involves three parameters: one to enable the API, one to set the IP address used by the security virtual appliance on the introspection vSwitch, and one to set the port number for that IP address.

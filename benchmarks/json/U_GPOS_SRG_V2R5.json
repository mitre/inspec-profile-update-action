Authentication sessions between the authenticator and the operating system validating the user credentials must not be vulnerable to a replay attack.\n\nAn authentication process resists replay attacks if it is impractical to achieve a successful authentication by recording and replaying a previous authentication message.\n\nA non-privileged account is any operating system account with authorizations of a non-privileged user.\n\nTechniques used to address this include protocols using nonces (e.g., numbers generated for a specific one-time use) or challenges (e.g., TLS, WS_Security). Additional techniques include time-synchronous or challenge-response one-time authenticators.","check":"Verify the operating system implements replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for network access to non-privileged accounts.

Sending notification of account removal events to the system administrator and ISSO is one method for mitigating this risk. Such a capability greatly reduces the risk that operating system accessibility will be negatively affected for extended periods of time and also provides logging that can be used for forensic purposes.\n\nTo address access requirements, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level authentication/access/auditing mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements.","check":"Verify the operating system notifies System Administrators and Information System Security Officers for account removal actions.

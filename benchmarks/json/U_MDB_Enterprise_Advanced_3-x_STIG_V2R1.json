Invalid user input is one of the primary methods employed when attempting to compromise an application.\n\nWith respect to database management systems, one class of threat is known as SQL Injection, or more generally, code injection. It takes advantage of the dynamic execution capabilities of various programming languages, including dialects of SQL. Potentially, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to data, including security settings, and severely corrupt or destroy the database.\n\nEven when no such hijacking takes place, invalid input that gets recorded in the database, whether accidental or malicious, reduces the reliability and usability of the system. Available protections include data types, referential constraints, uniqueness constraints, range checking, and application-specific logic. Application-specific logic can be implemented within the database in stored procedures and triggers, where appropriate.\n\nThis calls for inspection of application source code, which will require collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers, and may have limited, if any, access to source code.

At a minimum, the DBA must attempt to obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue has been addressed, and must document what has been discovered.","check":"For the MongoDB command-line tools \"mongo shell\", \"mongodump\", \"mongorestore\", \"mongoimport\", \"mongoexport\", which cannot be configured not to accept a plain-text password, and any other essential tool with the same limitation, verify that the system documentation explains the need for the tool, who uses it, and any relevant mitigations and that AO approval has been obtained. \n\nIf it is not documented, this is a finding. \n\nRequest evidence that all users of these MongoDB command-line tools are trained in the use of the \"-p\" option plain-text password option and how to keep the password protected from unauthorized viewing/capture and that they adhere to this practice. \n\nIf evidence of training does not exist, this is a finding.","fix":"For the \"mongo shell\", \"mongodump\", \"mongorestore\", \"mongoimport\", \"mongoexport\", which can accept a plain-text password, and any other essential tool with the same limitation: \n\nDocument the need for it, who uses it, and any relevant mitigations, and obtain AO approval. \n\nTrain all users of the tool in the nature of using the plain-text password option and in how to keep the password protected from unauthorized viewing/capture and document they have been trained."},"impact":0.7,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target MongoDB Enterprise Advanced 3.x"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-22915r411094_chk","severity":"high","gid":"V-221200","rid":"SV-221200r411096_rule","stig_id":"MD3X-00-000800","gtitle":"SRG-APP-000178-DB-000083","fix_id":"F-22904r411095_fix","documentable":null,"legacy":["SV-96641","V-81927"],"cci":["CCI-000206"],"nist":["IA-6"]}},{"id":"SV-221201","code":"control 'SV-221201' do\n  title 'MongoDB must be configured in accordance with the security configuration settings based on DoD security configuration and implementation guidance, including STIGs, NSA configuration guides, CTOs, DTMs, and IAVMs.'\n  desc 'Configuring MongoDB to implement organization-wide security implementation guides and security checklists ensures compliance with federal standards and establishes a common security baseline across DoD that reflects the most restrictive security posture consistent with operational requirements.\n\nIn addition to this SRG, sources of guidance on security and information assurance exist.

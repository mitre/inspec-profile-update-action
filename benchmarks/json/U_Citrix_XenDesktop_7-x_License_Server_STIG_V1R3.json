Since the classified NSI is unencrypted, the PDS must provide adequate electrical, electromagnetic, and physical safeguards to deter exploitation.","check":"Open the License Management Console, click \"Administration\", and select the \"Server Configuration\" tab.\n\nClick the \"Secure Web Server Configuration\" bar and verify \"Select Enable HTTPS (Default 443)\" is selected.\n\nIf \"Select Enable HTTPS (Default 443)\" is not selected, this is a finding.","fix":"1.

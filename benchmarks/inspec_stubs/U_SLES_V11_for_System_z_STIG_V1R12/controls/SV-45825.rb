Specific exceptions for local service administration should be documented in site-defined policy.  These exceptions may include HTTP(S)-based tools used for the administration of the local system, services, or attached devices.  Examples of possible exceptions are HPâ€™s System Management Homepage (SMH), the CUPS administrative interface, and Sun's StorageTek Common Array Manager (CAM) when these services are running on the local system."

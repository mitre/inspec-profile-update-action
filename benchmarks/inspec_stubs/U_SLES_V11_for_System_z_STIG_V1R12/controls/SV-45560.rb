Procedure:
# crontab -l
If such a cron job is found, this is not a finding.

Otherwise, query the SA. If there is a process automatically rotating audit logs, this is not a finding. If the SA manually rotates audit logs, this is a finding, because if the SA is not there, it will not be accomplished. If the audit output is not archived daily, to tape or disk, this is a finding. This can be ascertained by looking at the audit log directory and, if more than one file is there, or if the file does not have todayâ€™s date, this is a finding.'

  title 'The system vulnerability assessment tool, host-based intrusion detection tool, and file integrity tool must notify the SA and the IAO of a security breach or a suspected security breach.'
  desc 'Timely notifications of potential security compromises minimize the potential damage.

Minimally, the system must log these events and the SA and the IAO will receive the notifications during the daily system log review.  If feasible, active alerting (such as e-mail or paging) should be employed consistent with the site’s established operations management systems and procedures.'

If the output indicates that Secure Boot cannot be enabled, correctÂ the discrepancies and try again. If the discrepancies cannot be rectified this finding is downgraded to a CAT III.

Consult your vendor documentation and boot the host into BIOS setup mode. Enable UEFI boot mode and Secure Boot. Restart the host.

Temporarily enable SSH, connect to the ESXi host and run the following command to verify that Secure Boot is enabled:

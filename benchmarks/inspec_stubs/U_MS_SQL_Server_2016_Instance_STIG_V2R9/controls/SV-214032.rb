These unauthorized disclosures or modifications compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the information.

Use of this requirement will be limited to situations where the data owner has a strict requirement for ensuring data integrity and confidentiality is maintained at every step of the data transfer and handling process. 

SQL Server Service Broker endpoints support different encryption algorithms, including no-encryption. Using a weak encryption algorithm or plaintext in communication protocols can lead to data loss, data manipulation and/or connection hijacking.'

If SQL Service Broker is in use, run the following to check for encrypted transmissions: Â 

SELECT name, type_desc, encryption_algorithm_desc
FROM sys.service_broker_endpoints

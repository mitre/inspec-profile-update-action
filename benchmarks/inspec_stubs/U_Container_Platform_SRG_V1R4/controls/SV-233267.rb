  title 'The container platform runtime must generate audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to access objects occur.'
  desc 'Container platform runtime objects are defined as configuration files, code, etc. This provides the ability to configure resources and software parameters prior to image execution from the container platform registry. An unauthorized user with malicious intent could modify existing objects causing vulnerabilities or attacks. It would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate events relating to an incident or identify those responsible without audit record generation.

Without audit record generation, unauthorized users can access objects unknowingly for malicious intent creating vulnerabilities within the container platform.'

If audit records are not generated by the runtime when objects are successfully/unsuccessfully accessed, this is a finding.'

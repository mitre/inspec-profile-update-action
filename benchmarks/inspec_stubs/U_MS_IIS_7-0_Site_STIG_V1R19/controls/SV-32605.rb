  desc 'Windows Process Activation Service (WAS) manages application pool configuration and may flag a worker process as unhealthy and shut it down.  The rapid fail protection must be set to a suitable value.  A lack of response from the worker process might mean the worker process does not have a thread to respond to the ping request, or that it is hanging for some other reason. The ping interval and ping response time may need adjustment to gain access to timely information about application pool health without triggering false, unhealthy conditions.'

4. Scroll down to the Rapid Fail Protection section and ensure the value for Failure Interval is set to 5. If not, this is a finding.

NOTE: If the site has operational reasons to set Failure Interval to an alternate value, and has supporting documentation signed by the ISSO, this is not a finding.'

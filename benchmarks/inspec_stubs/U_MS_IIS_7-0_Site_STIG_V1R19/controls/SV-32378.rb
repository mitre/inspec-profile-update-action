By locating the web document (home) directory on the same partition as the web server system file the risk for unauthorized access to these protected files is increased.  Additionally, having the web document (home) directory path on the same drive as the system folders also increases the potential for a drive space exhaustion attack.'

Note: If the ISSO has accepted the risk of not configuring this setting due to hosted application operability issues or failures, this is not a finding.'

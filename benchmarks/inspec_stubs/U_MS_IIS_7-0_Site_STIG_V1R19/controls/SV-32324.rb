Ensuring all web content directories have at least the equivalent of an index.html file is a significant factor to accomplish this end. Also, enumeration techniques, such as URL parameter manipulation, rely upon being able to obtain information about the web serverâ€™s directory structure by locating directories with default pages. This practice helps ensure the anonymous web user will not obtain directory browsing information or an error message revealing the server type and version.'

  desc 'Organizations need to stay current with all applicable ESX Server software updates that are released from VMware. In order to be aware of updates as they are released, virtualization server administrators will subscribe to ESX Server vendor security notices, updates, and patches to ensure that all new vulnerabilities are known. New ESX Server patches and updates should be reviewed for the ESX Server before moving them into a production environment. ESX Server patches will be tested first in a development environment and any issues or special precautions will be documented, as a patch could technically disable all virtual networks and machines.'

# esxupdate â€“l query

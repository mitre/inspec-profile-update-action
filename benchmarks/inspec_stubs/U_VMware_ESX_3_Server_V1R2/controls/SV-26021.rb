a record of system activity. If the system fails, the SA must be notified and must take prompt 
action to correct the problem.

Minimally, the system must log this event and the SA will receive this notification during the 
daily system log review. If feasible, active alerting (such as email or paging) should be 
employed consistent with the siteâ€™s established operations management systems and procedures.'

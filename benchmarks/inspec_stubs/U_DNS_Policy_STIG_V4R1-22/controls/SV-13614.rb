In particular, each record (or related set of records, such as a group of LAN workstations) should be accompanied by a notation of the date the record was created, modified, or validated and record the ownerâ€™s name, title, and organizational affiliation.  The owner of a record is an individual with the authority to request that the record be modified or deleted.

If an organization cannot identify who is responsible for a host record, then there is no assurance that it is valid.  If invalid records are in a zone, then an adversary could potentially use their existence for improper purposes.'

Ask the DNS database administrator if they maintain a separate database with record documentation.  Windows DNS does not provide the capability to insert comments for records in a zone.  

Review the zone files/database. If the records are not fully documented, then this is a finding.  The zone record documentation is to include, at a minimum:

-	The owner of each zone record
-	The date the zone record was created
-	The date the zone record was last modified
-	The date the zone record was last verified

Records can be grouped (e.g., a number of workstations residing in the same area or a high-availability server cluster)'

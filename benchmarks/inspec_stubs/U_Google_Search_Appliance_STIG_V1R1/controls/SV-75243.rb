  desc "This control focuses on communications protection at the session, versus packet level. 

At the application layer, session IDs are tokens generated by web applications to uniquely identify an application user's session. Web applications utilize session tokens or session IDs in order to establish application user identity.  Proper use of session IDs addressed man-in-the-middle attacks including session hijacking or insertion of false information into a session. This control is only implemented where deemed necessary by the organization (e.g., sessions in service-oriented architectures providing web-based services)."

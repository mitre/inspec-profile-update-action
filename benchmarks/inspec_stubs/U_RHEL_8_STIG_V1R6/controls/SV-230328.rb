Check the home directory assignment for all non-privileged users, users with a User Identifier (UID) greater than 1000, on the system with the following command:

$ sudo awk -F: '($3>=1000)&&($7 !~ /nologin/){print $1,$3,$6}' /etc/passwd

adamsj 1001 /home/adamsj 
jacksonm 1002 /home/jacksonm 
smithj 1003 /home/smithj 

The output of the command will give the directory/partition that contains the home directories for the non-privileged users on the system (in this example, "/home") and usersâ€™ shell. All accounts with a valid shell (such as /bin/bash) are considered interactive users.

Check that a file system/partition has been created for the non-privileged interactive users with the following command:

Note: The partition of "/home" is used in the example.

$ sudo grep /home /etc/fstab

UUID=333ada18 /home ext4 noatime,nobarrier,nodev 1 2

If a separate entry for the file system/partition containing the non-privileged interactive user home directories does not exist, this is a finding.)

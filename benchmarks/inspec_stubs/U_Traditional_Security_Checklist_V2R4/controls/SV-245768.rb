  desc 'Failure to limit access for Foreign Nationals to classified information can result in the loss or compromise of NOFORN information. Documented local policies and procedures concerning what information FN employees or partners have access to and what they are excluded from having, what physical access limitations and allowances are in place, how to recognize a FN (badges, uniforms, etc.), steps to take to sanitize a work area before a FN can access the area, etc. are an essential part of controlling FN access. Just as important as development of policy and procedure is the training/familiarization of both employees and assigned FNs with the rules of interaction.

  desc 'check', 'Check to ensure that US employees clearly understand the differences and limitations between REL Officers, other NATO partners, Non-NATO partners and Coalition Partners. In a mixed US/FN partner environment the US personnel must know exactly what information can be shared and what cannot be shared or how to readily determine this information. For example the restrictions and cautions for partners from Belgium, Germany, France will be significantly greater relative to viewing anything on SIPRNet work stations versus the Australia, Canada, Great Britain partners. This can only be done if there are written local procedures and initial/recurring (at least annual) employee training to ensure familiarization with the rules for sharing classified and sensitive information with our partners. 

It is recommended that employees sign an acknowledgement that they understand their responsibilities for sharing information, but this is not to be required. 

This particular check should be validated by specifically checking for written procedures and training records. 

This subject can be included in the initial and annual site security awareness training but must be clearly detailed as having been properly completed. 

The effectiveness of the program can be validated by conducting random employee interviews concerning their understanding of rules covering sharing classified and sensitive information with FN partners assigned to or visiting their organization/site. 

Any one of the following three items: Lack of written procedures, lack of training, or evidence employees are not familiar with the rules for information sharing will result in a finding.

TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT: This check is applicable where REL partners/LN/FN are employed in a tactical environment with access to US Systems'

REQUIREMENT: There must be written local procedures and initial/recurring (at least annual) employee training to ensure familiarization with the rules for sharing classified and sensitive information with our partners. 

This topic must be included in the initial and annual site security awareness training. 

Any one of the following three items will result in a finding: 

1. Lack of written procedures, 
2. Lack of training, or 
3. Clear evidence employees are not familiar with the rules for information sharing.

NOTE: DODM 8570 requirements will be met until full implementation of DODM 8140.03 requirements. Implementation dates for DOD Manual 8140.03 include a two-year timeline for personnel (civilian and military) in positions coded with cybersecurity work roles and three years for personnel (civilian and military) in positions coded with work roles in any other workforce element. The dates for required qualification would be 15 February 2025 for cybersecurity work roles and the same date in February 2026 for all Defense Cyber Workforce Framework work roles.'

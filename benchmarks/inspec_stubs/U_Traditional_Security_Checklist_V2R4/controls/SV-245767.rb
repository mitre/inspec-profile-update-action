  title 'Foreign National (FN) Administrative Controls - Proper Investigation and Clearance for Access to Classified Systems and/or Information Assurance (IA) Positions of Trust'
  desc 'Failure to validate that FN partners or employees have the required security clearance levels for access to classified systems and/or the proper level of background investigation for IA Positions of Trust could result in untrustworthy Foreign Nationals having access to classified or sensitive US systems. In situations where they have been assigned to IA positions of trust this consideration becomes even more critical as they could adversely impact the CIA of the systems, possibly without being easily discovered.

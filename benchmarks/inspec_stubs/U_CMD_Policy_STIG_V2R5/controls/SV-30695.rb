Prior to disposing of a CMD (for example, if a CMD is transferred to another DoD or government agency), follow the disposal procedures found in the mobile operating system STIG Supplemental document. 

Interview the ISSO. 

Verify proper procedures are being followed and the procedures are documented. 

Check to see how retired, discarded, or transitioned CMDs were disposed of during the previous 6 â€“ 12 months and verify compliance with requirements. 

If procedures are not documented or if documented, they were not followed, this is a finding.'

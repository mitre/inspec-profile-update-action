  desc 'Without the ability to centrally manage the content captured in the log records, identification, troubleshooting, and correlation of suspicious behavior would be difficult and could lead to a delayed or incomplete analysis of an ongoing attack.

The content captured in log records must be managed from a central location (necessitating automation). Centralized management of log records and logs provides for efficiency in maintenance and management of records, as well as the backup and archiving of those records. Network components requiring centralized audit log management must have the capability to support centralized management.

The DoD requires centralized management of all network component audit record content.

This requirement only applies to components where this is specific to the function of the device (e.g., IDPS sensor logs, firewall logs). This does not apply to audit logs generated on behalf of the device itself (management).'

If the VPN Gateway does not provide centralized management and configuration of the content to be captured in log records generated by all network components, this is a finding.'

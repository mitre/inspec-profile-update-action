  title 'The Windows 2012 DNS Server must use DNSSEC data within queries to confirm data integrity to DNS resolvers.'
  desc 'The major threat associated with DNS forged responses or failures is the integrity of the DNS data returned in the response. The principle of DNSSEC is to mitigate this threat by providing data origin authentication, establishing trust in the source. By requiring remote clients to obtain origin authentication and integrity verification assurances for the host/service name to network address resolution information obtained through the service, data origin is validated.

A DNS server is an example of an information system providing name/address resolution service. Digital signatures and cryptographic keys are examples of additional artifacts. DNS resource records are examples of authoritative data. Applications other than the DNS, to map between host/service names and network addresses, must provide other means to assure the authenticity and integrity of response data. 

In the case of DNS, employ DNSSEC to provide an additional data origin and integrity artifacts along with the authoritative data the system returns in response to DNS name/address resolution queries.'
  desc 'check', 'Note: This check is Not applicable for Windows 2012 DNS Servers that only host Active Directory integrated zones or for Windows 2012 DNS servers on a Classified network.

Validate this check from the Windows 2012 DNS server being configured/reviewed.
Log on to the Windows 2012 DNS server using the account designated as Administrator or DNS Administrator.
Determine a valid host in the zone.
Open the Windows PowerShell prompt on the Windows 2012 DNS server being configured/reviewed.

Issue the following command:
(Replace www.zonename.mil with a FQDN of a valid host in the zone being validated. Replace ###.###.###.### with the FQDN or IP address of the Windows 2012 DNS Server hosting the signed zone.)

resolve-dnsname www.zonename.mil -server ###.###.###.### -dnssecok <enter>

NOTE: It is important to use the -server switch followed by the DNS Server name/IP address.

The result should show the "A" record results.

In addition, the results should show QueryType: RRSIG with an expiration, date signed, signer and signature, similar to the following:

Name: www.zonename.mil
QueryType: RRSIG
TTL: 189
Section: Answer
TypeCovered: CNAME
Algorithm: 8
LabelCount: 3
OriginalTtl: 300
Expiration: 11/21/2014 10:22:28 PM
Signed: 10/22/2014 10:22:28 PM
Signer: zonename.mil
Signature: {87, 232, 34, 134...}

Name: origin-www.zonename.mil
QueryType: A
TTL: 201
Section: Answer
IP4Address: ###.###.###.###

If the results do not show the RRSIG and signature information, this is a finding.'
  desc 'fix', 'Sign, or re-sign, the hosted zone(s) on the DNS server being validated.

Log on to the Windows 2012 DNS server using the account designated as Administrator or DNS Administrator.

Press Windows Key + R, execute dnsmgmt.msc.

On the opened DNS Manager snap-in from the left pane, expand the server name for the DNS server, and then expand Forward Lookup Zones.

From the expanded list, right-click to select the zone (repeat for each hosted zone), point to DNSSEC, and then click Sign the Zone, either using approved saved parameters or approved custom parameters.'

  title 'The Windows 2012 DNS Server must protect the integrity of transmitted information.'
  desc 'Without protection of the transmitted information, confidentiality and integrity may be compromised since unprotected communications can be intercepted and either read or altered.

Communication paths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification. Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical distribution systems) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques). If physical means of protection are employed, then logical means (cryptography) do not have to be employed, and vice versa.

Confidentiality is not an objective of DNS, but integrity is. DNSSEC and TSIG/SIG(0) both digitally sign DNS information to authenticate its source and ensure its integrity.'
  desc 'check', 'Note: This check is Not applicable for Windows 2012 DNS Servers that only host Active Directory integrated zones or for Windows 2012 DNS servers on a Classified network.

Validate this check from the Windows 2012 DNS server being configured/reviewed.
Log on to the Windows 2012 DNS server using the account designated as Administrator or DNS Administrator.
Determine a valid host in the zone.
Open the Windows PowerShell prompt on the Windows 2012 DNS server being configured/reviewed.

Issue the following command:
(Replace www.zonename.mil with a FQDN of a valid host in the zone being validated. Replace ###.###.###.### with the FQDN or IP address of the Windows 2012 DNS Server hosting the signed zone.)

resolve-dnsname www.zonename.mil -server ###.###.###.### -dnssecok <enter>

NOTE: It is important to use the -server switch followed by the DNS Server name/IP address.

The result should show the "A" record results.

In addition, the results should show QueryType: RRSIG with an expiration, date signed, signer and signature, similar to the following:

Name: www.zonename.mil
QueryType: RRSIG
TTL: 189
Section: Answer
TypeCovered: CNAME
Algorithm: 8
LabelCount: 3
OriginalTtl: 300
Expiration: 11/21/2014 10:22:28 PM
Signed 10/22/2014 10:22:28 PM
Signer: zonename.mil
Signature: {87, 232, 34, 134...}

Name: origin-www.zonename.mil
QueryType: A
TTL: 201
Section: Answer
IP4Address: ###.###.###.###

If the results do not show the RRSIG and signature information, this is a finding.'
  desc 'fix', 'Sign, or re-sign, the hosted zone(s) on the DNS server being validated.

Log on to the Windows 2012 DNS server using the account designated as Administrator or DNS Administrator.

Press Windows Key + R, execute dnsmgmt.msc.

On the opened DNS Manager snap-in from the left pane, expand the server name for the DNS server, and then expand Forward Lookup Zones.

From the expanded list, right-click to select the zone (repeat for each hosted zone), point to DNSSEC, and then click Sign the Zone, either using approved saved parameters or approved custom parameters.'

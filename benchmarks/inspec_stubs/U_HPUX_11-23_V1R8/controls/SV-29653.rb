  title 'The audit system must alert the SA when the audit storage volume approaches its capacity.'
  desc 'An accurate and current audit trail is essential for maintaining a record of system activity.  If the system fails, the SA must be notified and must take prompt action to correct the problem.

Minimally, the system must log this event and the SA will receive this notification during the daily system log review.  If feasible, active alerting (such as e-mail or paging) should be employed consistent with the siteâ€™s established operations management systems and procedures.'

Procedure:
# cat /etc/rc.config.d/auditing | grep AUDOMON_ARGS | grep "\\-w"

If the -w parameter does not exist, this is a finding. If the number following the -w parameter (which represents the threshold for percentage of capacity) is greater than 90, this is a finding.'

Cryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of information include, for example, signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography enabling distribution of the public key to verify the hash information while maintaining the confidentiality of the key used to generate the hash.'
  desc 'check', 'If LDAP is not being utilized, this requirement is Not Applicable.

Verify the operating system implements cryptography to protect the integrity of remote LDAP access sessions.

To determine if LDAP is being used for authentication, use the following command:

# systemctl status sssd.service
sssd.service - System Security Services Daemon
Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/sssd.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)
Active: active (running) since Wed 2018-06-27 10:58:11 EST; 1h 50min ago

If the "sssd.service" is "active", then LDAP is being used.

Determine the "id_provider" that the LDAP is currently using:

# grep -i "id_provider" /etc/sssd/sssd.conf

id_provider = ad

If "id_provider" is set to "ad", this is Not Applicable.

Check the path to the X.509 certificate for peer authentication with the following command:

# grep -i tls_cacert /etc/sssd/sssd.conf

ldap_tls_cacert = /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt

Verify the "ldap_tls_cacert" option points to a file that contains the trusted CA certificate.

If this file does not exist, or the option is commented out or missing, this is a finding.'

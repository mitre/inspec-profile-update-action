These unauthorized disclosures or modifications compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the information.

Use of this requirement will be limited to situations where the data owner has a strict requirement for ensuring data integrity and confidentiality is maintained at every step of the data transfer and handling process. 

SQL Mirroring endpoints support different encryption algorithms, including no-encryption. Using a weak encryption algorithm or plaintext in communication protocols can lead to data loss, data manipulation and/or connection hijacking.'

If Database Mirroring is in use, run the following to check for encrypted transmissions: Â 

SELECT name, type_desc, encryption_algorithm_desc

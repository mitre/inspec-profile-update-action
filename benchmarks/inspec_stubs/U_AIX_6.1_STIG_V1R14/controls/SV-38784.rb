  desc 'A file integrity baseline is a collection of file metadata which is to evaluate the integrity of the system. A minimal baseline must contain metadata for all device files, setuid files, setgid files, system libraries, system binaries, and system configuration files. The minimal metadata must consist of the mode, owner, group owner, and modification times. For regular files, metadata must also include file size and a cryptographic hash of the fileâ€™s contents.'

Open the above file and either manually execute md5sum, csum, or the chksum command on each file. Alternatively, write a script to perform the above. NOTE: For security purposes, "md5sum" is preferred over "chksum".  The md5sum command can be loaded from the Linux Tool Kit for AIX.  
Alternatively,   OpenSSL can be used to create hashes.

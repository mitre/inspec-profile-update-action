  desc "If a web browser flaw is exploited while running as a privileged user, the entire system could be compromised.

Specific exceptions for local service administration should be documented in site-defined policy.  These exceptions may include HTTP(S)-based tools used for the administration of the local system, services, or attached devices.  Examples of possible exceptions are HPâ€™s System Management Homepage (SMH), the CUPS administrative interface, and Sun's StorageTek Common Array Manager (CAM) when these services are running on the local system."

If there is one, verify with the root users and the IAO what the intent of the browsing is.  Some evidence may be obtained by using the browser to view cached pages under the .netscape directory.'

  desc 'Mobile devices include portable storage media (e.g., USB memory sticks, external hard disk drives) and portable computing and communications devices with information storage capability (e.g., notebook/laptop computers, personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, digital cameras, audio recording devices). 

Organization-controlled mobile devices include those devices for which the organization has the authority to specify and the ability to enforce specific security requirements.

Usage restrictions and implementation guidance related to mobile devices include configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software (e.g., malicious code detection, firewall), scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware (e.g., wireless, infrared).

In order to detect unauthorized mobile device connections, organizations must first identify and document what mobile devices are authorized.'

For Solaris 11, 11.1, 11.2, and 11.3:

# pkg info coherence-26
# pkg info coherence-27

If none of these packages are installed on the system, then no GUI is present.
For Solaris 11.4 or newer:
# pkg info gdm

If gdm is not installed on the system, then no GUI is present.

# pkg info uucp

uucp is no longer installed by default starting in 11.4 and is deprecated. 

For all versions, check that all users' home directories exist.

# pwck

Accounts with no home directory will output "Login directory not found".

If no GUI is present, then "gdm" and "upnp" accounts should generate errors. On all systems, with uucp package installed, the "uucp" and "nuucp" accounts should generate errors.

If users' home directories do not exist, this is a finding.)

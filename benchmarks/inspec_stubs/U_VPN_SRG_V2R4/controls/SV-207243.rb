  title 'The VPN Gateway must disable split-tunneling for remote clients VPNs.'
  desc 'Split tunneling would in effect allow unauthorized external connections, making the system more vulnerable to attack and to exfiltration of organizational information.

A VPN hardware or software client with split tunneling enabled provides an unsecured backdoor to the enclave from the Internet. With split tunneling enabled, a remote client has access to the Internet while at the same time has established a secured path to the enclave via an IPsec tunnel. A remote client connected to the Internet that has been compromised by an attacker in the Internet, provides an attack base to the enclaveâ€™s private network via the IPsec tunnel. Hence, it is imperative that the VPN gateway enforces a no split-tunneling policy to all remote clients.'
  desc 'check', 'Verify the VPN Gateway disables split-tunneling for remote clients VPNs.

If the VPN Gateway does not disable split-tunneling for remote clients VPNs, this is a finding.'

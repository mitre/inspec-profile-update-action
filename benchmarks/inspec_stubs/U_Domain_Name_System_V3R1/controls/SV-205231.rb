The key also can be used for securing other transactions, such as dynamic updates, DNS queries, and responses.

Verify all paper copies of the key files have been destroyed.

If the key files have been deleted and all paper copies have been destroyed, this is not a finding.
If the key files have been deleted but the paper copies have not been destroyed, this is a finding.
If the key files still exist, and the permissions on the key files have not been configured to only allow the server administrator account access, this is a finding.'

  title 'The DNS server implementation must behave in a predictable and documented manner that reflects organizational and system objectives when invalid inputs are received.'
  desc 'A common vulnerability of applications is unpredictable behavior when invalid inputs are received. This requirement guards against adverse or unintended system behavior caused by invalid inputs, where information system responses to the invalid input may be disruptive or cause the system to fail into an unsafe state. The behavior will be derived from the organizational and system requirements and includes, but is not limited to, notification of the appropriate personnel, creating an audit record, and rejecting invalid input. 

Attacks may be generated by entering invalid data into DNS transactions, in the hopes that the data will not be handled correctly and will allow a vulnerable condition to be exploited. To safeguard against this, all untrusted data entered in DNS transactions (e.g., DNS queries) should be checked for validity before being processed further.'
  desc 'check', 'Review the DNS server implementation configuration to determine if the DNS server behaves in a predictable and documented manner that reflects organizational and system objectives when invalid inputs are received. If the DNS server does not behave in such a manner, this is a finding.'

However, space will still be required on PostgreSQL server for audit records in transit, and, under abnormal conditions, this could fill up. Since a requirement exists to halt processing upon audit failure, a service outage would result.

If support personnel are not notified immediately upon storage volume utilization reaching 75 percent, they are unable to plan for storage capacity expansion.

Configure the system to notify appropriate support staff immediately upon storage volume utilization reaching 75 percent.

PostgreSQL does not monitor storage, however, it is possible to monitor storage with a script.

##### Example Monitoring Script

#!/bin/bash

PGDATA=/var/lib/psql/${PGVER?}/data
CURRENT=$(df ${PGDATA?} | grep / | awk '{ print $5}' | sed 's/%//g')
THRESHOLD=75

if [ "$CURRENT" -gt "$THRESHOLD" ] ; then
mail -s 'Disk Space Alert' mail@support.com << EOF
The data directory volume is almost full. Used: $CURRENT
%EOF

Schedule this script in cron to run around the clock.)

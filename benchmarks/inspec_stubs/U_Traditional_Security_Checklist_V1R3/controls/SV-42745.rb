  title 'Periodic Reinvestigations - Submitted in a Timely Manner based Upon Position Sensitivity and Type of Investigation Required'
  desc 'Failure to subject personnel to periodic reinvestigation can result in derogatory information not being discovered on personnel having access to sensitive or classified information.

Background Information:

All positions (military and civilian) must be categorized as either non-sensitive, noncritical-sensitive, or critical-sensitive based on security clearance and/or ADP (AKA: IT) position requirements.  This is the process detailed within the legacy DoD 5200.2-R, DoD Personnel Security Program, which is dated September 1987 and last updated in February 1996.  In recent years a fourth category called special-sensitive was added by OPM for all Federal agencies (to include the DoD).  This is detailed in the current  DOD Manual 5200.02, Procedures for the DoD Personnel Security Program (PSP), dated 3 April 2017, which superseded the legacy DoD 5200.2-R.
  
The significance of designating position sensitivity is that the type of background investigation the incumbent of a particular position must undergo (e.g., SSBI (now Tier 5 investigation) or NACI (now Tier 3 investigation)) is based upon the designated position sensitivity.
  
As of 1 October 2016, the former investigations known as NACLAC, ANACI, NACI, BI, MBI, SSBI, etc. are no longer conducted.  These investigations have been replaced by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) with a "Tiered" Investigation process.
 
The new investigations are grouped in five levels or tiers and so investigations are now referred to as Tier 1-5, with Tier 5 (T5) being the most stringent investigation.

The update to the DOD PERSEC Program contained in the DOD Manual 5200.02, Procedures for the DoD Personnel Security Program (PSP), dated 3 April 2017 does not contain any implementing guidance for moving from the former investigations to the new Tiered Investigations.

With regard to Information Assurance Positions of Trust (e.g., those with privileged access and/or responsibility for security oversight of information systems) for DoD Information Network (DoDIN) (AKA: Defense Information System Network (DISN)) assets, the two most applicable levels of investigation are Tier 3 and Tier 5.  Examples of jobs or duties associated with IA Positions of Trust are System Administrators (SA), Information System Security Managers (ISSM), and Information System Security Officers (ISSO).

Tier 3 investigations are those generally associated with Non-Critical Sensitive positions of trust (confidential or secret security clearance or legacy ADP/IT-2 level duties).  Examples of the former investigations which are now Tier 3 are NACLAC and ANACI.  Tier 5 investigations are those generally associated with Special-Sensitive and/or Critical Sensitive positions of trust (TS clearances with or w/o SCI/SAP or legacy ADP/IT-1 level duties).  The former investigation that is now Tier 5 is the SSBI.

In the next 5-10 years it is reasonable to expect that a combination of both the old investigations and the new Tier investigations will be found within the DoD until the new investigations are completely phased-in for current personnel.  Therefore, security personnel must be familiar with both the old and new investigations.

While Contractor personnel are not formally assigned to positions within DoD organizations, the type of investigation required is like that of DoD civilians and military personnel in that it is based on the legacy IT/ADP level and/or security clearance requirements for each type or category of work performed.  Duties associated with positions or described functions along with security clearance and/or ADP levels and associated investigations must be detailed in the applicable Statement of Work (SOW) and/or DD Form 254 (Contract Security Specification).  

With regard to legacy ADP/IT level designations the following general rules apply:

Users of DoD Information Systems (IS) are either privileged users (e.g., system administrators) or authorized (AKA: basic/general) users. 

Privileged users must undergo a SSBI/Tier 5 investigation, while general system users within the DoD must undergo a NACLAC, ANACI, NACI/Tier 3 investigation.  

With regard to security clearance levels the following general rules apply:

Persons requiring a confidential or secret security clearance for their position or duties are required to undergo a favorably adjudicated NACLAC, ANACI, NACI/Tier 3 investigation.

Persons requiring higher level security clearance such as top secret (TS) or TS with Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) access must undergo a favorably adjudicated SSBI/Tier 5 investigation.

Under the new Tiered Investigation process the OPM provides the Position Designation Automated Tool (PDT) as an aide for those individuals within agencies charged with position designation responsibilities.  The tool is found at the following URL:

https://www.opm.gov/suitability/suitability-executive-agent/position-designation-tool/

The PDT provides Federal Agencies a means to effectively and consistently determine position designations.

The OPM Position Designation System and the related PDT assesses the duties and responsibilities of a position to determine the degree of potential damage to the efficiency or integrity of the service from misconduct of an incumbent of a position. This establishes the risk level of that position. This assessment also determines if a position’s duties and responsibilities present the potential for position incumbents to bring about a material adverse effect on the national security, and the degree of that potential effect, which establishes the sensitivity level of a position. The results of this assessment determine what level of investigation should be conducted for a position.

To reduce subjectivity in the position sensitivity determination process security personnel must understand the following terms when using the PDT:

NATIONAL SECURITY refers to those activities which are directly concerned with the foreign relations of the United States, or protection of the Nation from internal subversion, foreign aggression, or terrorism.

A NATIONAL SECURITY POSITION, includes any position in a department or agency, the occupant of which could bring about, by virtue of the nature of the position, a material adverse effect on the national security.

NON-SENSITIVE POSITIONS/DUTIES are PUBLIC TRUST POSITIONS or duties and responsibilities that are unrelated to National Security.

*Keep in mind that the primary mission of most DoD organizations concerns the national security.  Hence all Information Technology (IT) positions involved with the DoD (DISN) cyber security mission should be considered as National Security Positions.  These positions are for instance System Administrators (SA), Information System Security Managers (ISSM), Information System Security Officers (ISSO), Information System Engineers and other related positions, which are detailed in the DoD 8570.01-M, Information Assurance Workforce Improvement Program, 19 December 2005, Incorporating Change 4, 11/10/2015.

Again, the outcome of using the PDT should generally be the same as the DoD requirements for position sensitivity under the legacy ADP/IT position criteria but the individual using the tool must have a thorough understanding of the duties and impact of the duties of each position being assessed for the PDT outcome to be appropriate and consistent with the DoD standards.  It is important to limit the subjectivity involved with these determinations and provide consistent results throughout the DoD.

PRIVILEGED ACCESS TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS: 
A key legacy consideration for IA positions of trust is that any position where an incumbent has “Privileged Access” to an information system should normally be designated as a Critical-Sensitive position.   *This is regardless if there is a corresponding requirement for the incumbent to have a TS security clearance or not.  Generally the TS clearance is the predominate requirement for designation of position sensitivity as critical-sensitive; however, where there is a requirement for either a secret, confidential, or no security clearance and the incumbent also has a requirement for privileged access to an information system – the privileged access criterial will make the position critical-sensitive with a Tier-5 (T-5) background investigation requirement.  

Hence, the privileged access criteria consideration is beyond the typical noncritical-sensitive or non-sensitive position designations associated with only a secret, confidential, or no security clearance normally resulting in a Tier-3 (T-3) or lower level investigation requirement. 

PRIVILEGED ACCESS DEFINED:
The following definition of privileged access is excerpted from the DoD 8570.01-M, Information Assurance Workforce Improvement Program.

Privileged Access is an authorized user who has access to system control, monitoring, administration, criminal investigation, or compliance functions. Privileged access typically provides access to the following system controls:

-Access to the control functions of the information system/network, administration of user accounts, etc.

-Access to change control parameters (e.g., routing tables, path priorities, addresses) of routers, multiplexers, and other key information system/network equipment or software.

-Ability and authority to control and change program files, and other users’ access to data.

-Direct access to operating system level functions (also called unmediated access) that would permit system controls to be bypassed or changed.

-Access and authority for installing, configuring, monitoring, or troubleshooting the security monitoring functions of information systems/networks (e.g., network/system analyzers; intrusion detection software; firewalls) or in performance of cyber/network defense operations.
************end of Privileged Access Definition*********

THE BOTTOM LINE:
The association of DoD position sensitivity designation and required investigations is based on IA position of trust system access levels and/or level of responsibility for oversight of systems security  in conjunction with the level of security clearance required for military or civilian positions *or type of work performed by contractor employees.  The relationship of position sensitivity to clearances, duties and investigations can be delineated as follows:

*Special-Sensitive and/or Critical- Sensitive positions:  
   Legacy IT-1 (ADP-1)
   Privileged users (SAs) and/or
   ISSM/ISSO and/or 
   TS or TS-SCI clearance
   SSBI/Tier 5 investigations

**Non-Critical Sensitive positions:  
    Legacy IT-2 (ADP-2)
    Privileged users under direct supervision of an ADP-1 vetted Privileged user and/or
    Authorized users and/or 
    Confidential or secret security clearance 
    NACLAC, ANACI, NACI/Tier 3 investigations

***Non-Sensitive positions:
      Legacy IT-3 (ADP-3) and no security clearance; Not Applicable for current DoD cyber security positions

In summary the primary criteria for association of DoD position sensitivity designation and required background investigations is the security clearance required for military or civilian positions or for the type of work performed by contractor employees.  The second most influential criteria for determination of position sensitivity and background investigations required are information assurance/cyber security positions of trust, which is determined based upon designated legacy ADP/IT levels.  Therefore both security clearance and ADP/IT levels must be considered concurrently for designation of position sensitivity and associated background investigations required.  The highest level of background investigation required by either security clearance or ADP/IT level for performance of duties must be conducted for incumbents of (military/civilian) positions or duties performed by contractor employees.

If the "-t" option is not set for the "saslauthd" process in the system boot script, this is a finding.'
  desc 'fix', "With MongoDB configured using SASL LDAP authentication and on certain Linux distributions, saslauthd starts with the caching of authentication credentials enabled. 

Until restarted or until the cache expires, saslauthd will not contact the LDAP server to re-authenticate users in its authentication cache. This allows saslauthd to successfully authenticate users in its cache, even in the LDAP server is down or if the cached users' credentials are revoked.

To set the expiration time (in seconds) for the authentication cache, see the -t option of saslauthd (https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/8-saslauthd/)."

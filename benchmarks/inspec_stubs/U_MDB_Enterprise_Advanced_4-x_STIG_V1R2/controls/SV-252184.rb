Systems at unsupported servicing levels or releases will not receive security updates for new vulnerabilities, which leaves them subject to exploitation.

When maintenance updates and patches are no longer available, the database software is no longer considered supported and should be upgraded or decommissioned.'

Identify all database software components. Review the version and release information.

To determine the current running MongoDB server version, run the following command from the Mongo Shell:

db.version() 

Access the MongoDB website (https://www.mongodb.com/support-policy/lifecycles) or use other means to verify if the currently running MongoDB server version is still supported.
 
If the DBMS or any of the software components are not supported by MongoDB, this is a finding.'

Check the home directory assignment for all non-privileged users, users with a User Identifier (UID) greater than 1000, on the system with the following command: 
 
     $ sudo awk -F: '($3>=1000)&&($1!="nobody"){print $1,$3,$6}' /etc/passwd 
 
     doej 1001 /home/doej 
     publicj 1002 /home/publicj 
     smithj 1003 /home/smithj 
 
The output of the command will give the directory that contains the home directories for the nonprivileged users on the system (in this example, "/home") and usersâ€™ shell. All accounts with a valid shell (such as "/bin/bash") are considered interactive users. 
 
Check that a file system has been created for the nonprivileged interactive users with the following command. 
 
Note: The partition of "/home" is used in the example. 
 
     $ sudo grep /home /etc/fstab 
 
     /dev/mapper/...   /home   xfs   defaults,noexec,nosuid,nodev 0 0
 
If a separate entry for the file system that contains the nonprivileged interactive users' home directories does not exist, this is a finding.)

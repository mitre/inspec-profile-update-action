  title 'The Voice Video Endpoint used for unclassified communication within a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) or Special Access Program Facility (SAPF) must be National Telecommunications Security Working Group (NTSWG)-approved device in accordance with the Committee on National Security Systems Instruction (CNSSI) 5000.'
  desc 'Configuring the Voice Video Endpoint to implement CNSSI 5000 for unclassified communication within SCIFs and SAPF ensures compliance with federal standards and establishes a common security baseline across DoD that reflects the most restrictive security posture consistent with operational requirements.

Voice Video Endpoints may transmit classified conversations over unclassified networks. Voice Video Endpoint microphones, speakers, and supporting electronics may pick up conversation audio within the area and conduct it over the network connection, even when the endpoint is on-hook, powered or not. The Technical Surveillance Counter-Measures (TSCM) program protects sensitive government information, to include classified information, through the establishment of on-hook audio security standards. Voice Video Endpoints certified by NTSWG are modified to prevent this behavior, or limit it to within acceptable levels.

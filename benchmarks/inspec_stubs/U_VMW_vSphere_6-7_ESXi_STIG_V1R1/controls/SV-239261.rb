By gathering host log files onto a central host, it can more easily monitor all hosts with a single tool. It can also do aggregate analysis and searching to look for such things as coordinated attacks on multiple hosts. Logging to a secure, centralized log server also helps prevent log tampering and also provides a long-term audit record.

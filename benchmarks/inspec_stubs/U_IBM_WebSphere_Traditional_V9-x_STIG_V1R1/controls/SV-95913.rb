  desc 'In previous releases of WebSphereÂ® Application Server, when a user enabled global security, both administrative and application security were enabled.  The previous notion of global security is split into administrative security and application security, each of which you can enable separately.

As a result of this split, WebSphere Application Server clients must know whether application security is disabled at the target server. Administrative security is enabled, by default. Application security is disabled, by default. Before you can enable application security, you must verify that administrative security is enabled. Application security is in effect only when administrative security is enabled.'

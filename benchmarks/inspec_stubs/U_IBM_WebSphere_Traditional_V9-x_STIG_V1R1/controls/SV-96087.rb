  desc "This control focuses on communications protection at the session, versus packet level.

At the application layer, session IDs are tokens generated by web applications to uniquely identify an application user's session. Web applications utilize session tokens or session IDs in order to establish application user identity. Proper use of session IDs addresses man-in-the-middle attacks, including session hijacking or insertion of false information into a session.

Application servers must provide the capability to perform mutual authentication. Mutual authentication is when both the client and the server authenticate each other."

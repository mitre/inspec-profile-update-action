  desc 'It is critical for the appropriate personnel to be aware if a system is at risk of failing to process audit logs as required. Without this notification, the security personnel may be unaware of an impending failure of the audit capability and system operation may be adversely affected.

Audit processing failures include software/hardware errors, failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded. Possible audit processing failures also include the inability of ALG to write to the central audit log.

While this requirement also applies to the event monitoring system (e.g., Syslog, Security Information and Event Management [SIEM], or SNMP servers), CounterACT can also be configured to send notifications.'

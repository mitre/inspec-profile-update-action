Improper changes to the schema could result in changes to AD objects that are incompatible with correct operation of the Windows domain controller and the domain clients. This could cause outages that prevent users from logging on or accessing Windows server resources across multiple hosts.'

2. Obtain a copy of the siteâ€™s configuration management procedures documentation.

3. Verify that there is a local policy that requires changes to the directory schema to be processed through a configuration management process. This applies to directory schema changes whether implemented in a database or other types of files. For AD, this refers to changes to the AD schema.

4. If there is no policy that requires changes to the directory schema to be processed through a configuration management process, then this is a finding.'

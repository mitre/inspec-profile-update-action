  title 'Deficient SOP or enforcement regarding the use of software based virtual connection between the PC and the VTC CODEC.'
  desc 'VTC CODECs provide various means and methods to permit the display of presentations and various other forms of data to all of the endpoints in a conference. Typically, this involves connecting a PC workstation, on which the presentation is displayed and controlled, to a CODEC which distributes the presentation to the conferees. Care in operating this feature must be exercised so that the PC user does not inadvertently display information on their workstation that is not part of the conference and is not intended to be viewed by the conferees. Users must be aware that anything that they display on their PC workstation display while connected to the CODEC will be displayed on all of the conference monitors. This collaboration/display feature could result in the disclosure of sensitive or classified information to individuals that do not have a validated need-to-know or have the proper clearance to view the information. This is a problem when sharing a PC desktop via any collaboration tool using any connection method.

The first of the PC-CODEC interconnection methods, supported by most (but not all) CODECs, is the direct connection of the PC video output to an external video input on the CODEC. This method is most common interconnection method, is most secure, and is the recommended method for DoD. This is the only method available to users of VTUs connected to ISDN only (i.e., not connected to an IP network in addition to the ISDN lines).The second method for PC-CODEC interconnection for data/presentation sharing is to establish a virtual connection between the CODEC and PC workstation across an IP based LAN. While this method is implemented in different ways by different vendors, most if not all methods require the installation of an application or a utility on the PC workstation that is to share its data or display. While this method is convenient, since it does not require a cable connected to the CODEC, it presents varying degrees of vulnerability to the PC and the data it contains depending upon the particular application or utility installed. Additionally, the installation of such software is contrary to most DoD policy regarding approved workstation applications. All such software must be thoroughly evaluated and approved before installation.

Most vendors provide a proprietary application or utility that is loaded on the PC workstation to establish the virtual connection between the PC and CODEC. The main purpose and capability of this utility is to capture the PC’s display graphics and send it to the CODEC. Typically, these utilities require only the IP address of the CODEC. The CODEC may or may not require a password to accept this input. When reading the documentation on these utilities there is no indication that the media stream generated by these utilities is encrypted. This may or may not be an issue depending upon the protocols used by the utility. Sniffing the stream may or may not reveal the displayed information. One vendor provides a utility to upload MS PowerPoint files to the CODEC and display them using an embedded viewer. This same vendor provides another utility to integrate with MS NetMeeting on the PC and stream content from there using T.120 protocol. 

An additional feature of some of these utilities is the capability of conferees to share and work on files across the connection between CODECs. This feature brings a larger set of collaboration tool features to the VTC arena. 

At least one vendor’s virtual connection method requires the installation of PC remote control desktop sharing software on the PC. Once the remote control/access server application is running, anybody with the matching or compatible viewer/control application and the access password can connect to the PC workstation from another PC workstation. This provides full control of its resources and access to all of its files since this is the purpose of this type of application. This type of application can receive remote keyboard and mouse inputs as if the user was sitting at the PC itself controlling it. As such this method is capable of much more than capturing the graphics displayed on the PC monitor and sending it to a CODEC. As such an adversary could gain full control of the PC workstation at any time when the server application is running, whether there is a conference being displayed or not. Many such server applications are started as a service when the workstation is booted. This means that the connection is available to an adversary any time the PC is running. This is a huge vulnerability for the PC workstation. 
As such, the use of virtual connection methods must first be approved by the DAA and must be tightly controlled. 

Another issue that must be addressed is the access control between the VTU and the PC. This discussion and/or requirements are dependent upon the direction of the access. (i.e., PC to VTU or VTU to PC) Access to a PC (from a VTU), by policy, requires a strong policy compliant password (and other measures, supported or not). Such a password cannot be entered from a VTU remote control unless an on screen keyboard (or cell phone text entry requiring password display) is used thus opening the password to shoulder surfing or being viewed by a conference room full of people (discussed earlier). If the VTU is to initiate the connection to the PC, it is best to store a strong password on the VTU that will identify the VTU to the PC sharing application. The sharing application is only run when needed when the PC is required to interface with the VTU; it is not run as a service that is constantly available. Other constraints could apply. The recommended alternative is to initiate all VTU - PC connections from the PC and implementing the appropriate access control in the VTU in compliance with password policy if a virtual connection is to be used. Better yet, use a direct connection using a video out connection on the PC.  

Furthermore, it is recommended that, if the remote control/access method is used, a PC workstation be dedicated to the purpose of displaying presentations on the CODEC. No other information should be placed on this PC. The PC should be turned off or disconnected from the LAN when a presentation is not being displayed to a conference. In this way, the installation of the remote control/access software will not place non conference information at risk.'
  desc 'check', '[IP]; Interview the IAO to validate compliance with the following requirement:

In the event a software based virtual connection between a PC/workstation and a CODEC is to be used for presentation display, file transfer, or collaboration, the IAO will ensure the following:
- Additional appropriate policy and procedures for this type of connection are added to the required “Presentation/PC workstation display sharing” policy and procedure. These are based on the particular vendor’s solution to be implemented.
- Additional appropriate user training is added to the training requirement noted above.
- Perform and document an assessment of the application to be used to verify that it performs only those functions that are necessary, that the application behaves properly on the platform, and that it does not invalidate the security of the workstation.
- Perform and document a risk assessment regarding the use of the application in light of the application assessment and the defined operational policy/procedures.
- The responsible DAA approves, in writing, the installation of the additional software to the PC workstation(s) required to use this method.
- The responsible DAA approves, in writing, the implementation and use procedures that mitigate the application’s vulnerabilities.
     
Note: Assessments should be performed and DAA approvals should be obtained prior to purchase. 
     
Note: The IAO will maintain the policy, procedures, assessment documentation, risk assessment, and DAA approvals for inspection by IA auditors as evidence of compliance.

Verify that additional and appropriate user training is added to the training requirement as noted in RTS-VTC 2460.00 that addresses additional vulnerabilities associated with presentation, application, and desktop sharing to a VTU from a PC.
AND
Verify additional vendor specific procedures and policies have been implemented.  
AND
Verify that assessments have been performed and documented to validate additional VTU application(s) has not invalidated the security of the workstation.  Verify with the IAO that a risk assessment has been performed and documented.  
AND
Verify that DAA has approved in writing the installation of additional VTU software and the DAA is aware and approved the implementation and procedures used to mitigate the VTU application(s) vulnerabilities

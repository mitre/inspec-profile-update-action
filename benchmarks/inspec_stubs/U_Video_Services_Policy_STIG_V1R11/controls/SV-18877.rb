  desc 'Some VTC endpoints can be monitored using SNMP. It is also possible that if not today, in the future, VTC endpoints could be configured via SNMP. SNMP is typically used by vendorâ€™s VTU/MCU management applications but it is conceivable that SNMP traps could be sent to any SNMP compatible network management system. At the time of this writing, applicable STIG requirements for the use of SNMP are contained in the Network Infrastructure STIG.'

If SNMP is used to monitor or remotely control/manage/configure a VTC system/device, ensure the use of SNMP is performed in compliance with the applicable SNMP requirements found in the Network Infrastructure STIG.
   
This is a finding if SNMP is not being used in accordance with the Network Infrastructure STIG.
   
Note: During APL testing, this is a finding in the event SNMP configuration cannot come into compliance with the Network Infrastructure STIG.'

If SNMP is used to monitor or remotely control/manage/configure a VTC system/device, implement and configure SNMP in compliance with the applicable SNMP requirements found in the Network Infrastructure STIG.'

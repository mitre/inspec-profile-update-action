  desc 'A log server (loghost) receives syslog messages from one or more systems. This data can be used as an additional log source in the event a system is compromised and its local logs are suspect. Forwarding log messages to a remote loghost also provides system administrators with a centralized place to view the status of multiple hosts within the enterprise.'

If using TCP, a line similar to the following should be present: 

*.* @@[loghost.example.com]

If using RELP, a line similar to the following should be present:

Along with these other directives, the system can be configured to forward its logs to a particular log server by adding or correcting one of the following lines, substituting "[loghost.example.com]" appropriately. The choice of protocol depends on the environment of the system; although TCP and RELP provide more reliable message delivery, they may not be supported in all environments.

To use RELP for log message delivery:

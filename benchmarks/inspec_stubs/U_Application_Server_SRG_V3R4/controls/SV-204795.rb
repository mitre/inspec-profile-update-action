  desc 'To investigate an incident, the log records should be easily put into chronological order.  Without sufficient granularity of time stamps, the chronological order cannot be determined.

Time stamps generated by the application server include date and time.  Granularity of time measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between information system clocks and reference clocks.'

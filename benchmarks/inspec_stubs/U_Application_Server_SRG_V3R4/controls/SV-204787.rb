  title 'The application server must provide centralized management and configuration of the content to be captured in log records generated by all application components.'
  desc 'A clustered application server is made up of several servers working together to provide the user a failover and increased computing capability.  To facilitate uniform logging in the event of an incident and later forensic investigation, the record format and logable events need to be uniform.  This can be managed best from a centralized server.

Without the ability to centrally manage the content captured in the log records, identification, troubleshooting, and correlation of suspicious behavior would be difficult and could lead to a delayed or incomplete analysis of an ongoing attack.'
  desc 'check', 'Review application server documentation and configuration to determine if the application server is part of a cluster.

If the application server is not part of a cluster, this requirement is NA.

If the application server is part of a cluster, verify that the log settings are managed and configured from a centralized management server.

If the log settings are not centrally managed, this is a finding.'

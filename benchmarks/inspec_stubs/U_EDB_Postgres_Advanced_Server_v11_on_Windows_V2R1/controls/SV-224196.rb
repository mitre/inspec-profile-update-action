The DBMS must provide a unified tool for audit configuration."

If managing multiple EDB Postgres Advanced Server clusters and a unified tool for audit configuration such as PEM (Postgres Enterprise Manager) is not installed to configure and manage audit logs, this is a finding.

Review the system documentation for a description of how audit records are off-loaded and how local audit log space is managed.'

The NSA Commercial Solutions for Classified (CSfC) registration process requires CSfC-listed equipment be used in the campus WLAN system. The site should perform a security assessment prior to operating the system to confirm it is compliant and periodically, thereafter, to verify the system is still in compliance with the most recent version of the capability package.'

The assessment should be successfully completed (no findings) before the systems Initial Operating Capability (IOC) is achieved and yearly thereafter. It is recommended that the assessment be completed by an organization that is separate from the organization that is setting up and managing the campus WLAN system.

-Review the registration agreement between the site and NSA to determine if any deviations from the Campus WLAN Capability Package have been approved by NSA.

-Review security assessment reports from assessments completed before IOC or yearly thereafter and interview the site IAM/IAO. Determine the date of the last assessment and if there are any open findings from the report.

-If security assessments were not completed prior to IOC or yearly thereafter or if assessments were completed but there were open findings listed in the last report, this is a finding.'

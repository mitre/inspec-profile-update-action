Prior to disposing of a CMD (for example, if a CMD is transferred to another DoD or government agency), follow the disposal procedures found in the STIG Technology Overview document of the STIG for the CMD of interest. For example, look in the BlackBerry Overview document in the BlackBerry STIG for the disposal procedures for a BlackBerry smartphone. 

Interview the IAO. 

Verify proper procedures are being followed and the procedures are documented. 

Check to see how retired, discarded, or transitioned CMDs were disposed of during the previous 6 â€“ 12 months and verify compliance with requirements. 

Mark as a finding if procedures are not documented or if documented, they were not followed.'

  desc 'There will be situations that require the import or export of VMDK files on the VMFS partition.  Importing and exporting disk files can also be done through the Virtual Infrastructure Client or service console by copying the files from VMFS mount and pasting them to a partition running ext3 file system. Utilizing the VMware-converter utility is required since the VMFS file system utilizes such large files. There are third-party converters available that may work with VMware virtual machines, however, none have been thoroughly tested or approved by VMware.'

If they are using a third party converter, ensure that the converter is supported by the vendor.  This might require going to the vendorâ€™s website and verifying the version used is supported.  If it is not, this is a finding.'
  desc 'fix', 'Use the VMware-converter for all import and export of VMDK files to VMFS partitions.'

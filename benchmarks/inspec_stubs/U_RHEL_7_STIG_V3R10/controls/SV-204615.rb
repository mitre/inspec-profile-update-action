If "net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects" is not configured in the /etc/sysctl.conf file or in any of the other sysctl.d directories, is commented out, or does not have a value of "0", this is a finding.

Check that the operating system implements the "accept_redirects" variables with the following command:

     # /sbin/sysctl -a | grep net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects
     net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0

If the returned line does not have a value of "0", this is a finding.

If conflicting results are returned, this is a finding.'

Issue the following command to make the changes take effect:

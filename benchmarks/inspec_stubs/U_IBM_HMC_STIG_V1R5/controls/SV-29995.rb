  desc 'The ESCON Director Console Event Log is used to record all ESCON Director Changes. Failure to create an ESCON Director Application Console Event log results in the lack of monitoring and accountability of configuration changes. In addition, its use in the execution of a contingency plan could be compromised and security degraded.  NOTE: Many newer installations no longer support the ESCON Director Console.  For installations not supporting the ESCON Director Console, this check is not applicable.'

The ESCON Director maintains an audit trail at the ESCD consoleâ€™s fixed disk. This audit trail logs the time, date, and password identification when changes have been made to the ESCON Director.'

  title 'OHS must have a log file defined for each site/virtual host to capture logs generated that allow the establishment of when an event occurred.'
  desc 'Web server logging capability is critical for accurate forensic analysis. Without sufficient and accurate information, a correct replay of the events cannot be determined. 

Ascertaining the correct order of the events that occurred is important during forensic analysis. Events that appear harmless by themselves might be flagged as a potential threat when properly viewed in sequence. By also establishing the event date and time, an event can be properly viewed with an enterprise tool to fully see a possible threat in its entirety.

Without sufficient information establishing when the log event occurred, investigation into the cause of event is severely hindered. Log record content that may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this control includes, but is not limited to, time stamps, source and destination IP addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, application-specific events, success/fail indications, file names involved, access control, or flow control rules invoked.'

2. Search for the "CustomLog" directive at the OHS server and virtual host configuration scopes.

3. If the directive is omitted or set improperly, this is a finding unless inherited from a larger scope.

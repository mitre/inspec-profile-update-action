User-level information is data generated by the information system and/or application users. In order to assure availability of this data in the event of a system failure, DoD organizations are required to ensure user-generated data is backed up at a defined frequency. This includes data stored on file systems, within SQL Server or within any other storage media.

Applications performing backups must be configured to back up user-level information per the DoD-defined frequency.

SQL Server Database backups provide the required means to restore databases after compromise or loss. Backups help reduce the vulnerability to unauthorized access or hardware loss.'

Evidence of implementation includes records of backup events and physical review of backup media.

Evidence should match the backup plan as recorded in the system documentation.

If backup procedures do not exist or are not implemented in accordance with the procedures, this is a finding.'

  title 'Administrators must utilize a separate, distinct administrative account when performing administrative activities, accessing database security functions, or accessing security-relevant information within SQL Server.'
  desc 'This requirement is intended to limit exposure due to operating from within a privileged account or role. The inclusion of role is intended to address those situations where an access control policy, such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), is being implemented and where a change of role provides the same degree of assurance in the change of access authorizations for both the user and all processes acting on behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between a privileged and non-privileged account.

To limit exposure when operating from within a privileged account or role, SQL Server does support organizational requirements that users of information system accounts, or roles, with access to an organization-defined list of security functions or security-relevant information, use non-privileged accounts, or roles, when accessing other (non-security) system functions.

When privileged activities are not separated from non-privileged activities, SQL Server could be subject to unauthorized changes of settings or data, which a standard user would not normally have access to outside of an authorized maintenance session. Often, administrator accounts have a unique prefix to help with identification. These accounts are located within SQL Server and may only provide access to one database instance or a limited number of database objects.'

SELECT SP1.[name] AS 'Login', 'Role: ' + SP2.[name] COLLATE DATABASE_DEFAULT AS 'ServerPermission'

If any DBA or administrative objects are owned by non-DBA or non-administrative accounts, this is a finding.

If any DBA or administrator has authorization for non- administrative access to the system for which they are the administrator and they do not have a non-administrator account, this is a finding."

Remove the permission access from the account that has direct access by running the following script:
USE master
REVOKE <'server privilege name'> TO <'account name'>
GO

Remove the user account from the role's Member list where the account is not authorized for specified permission by running the following script:
USE master
ALTER SERVER ROLE [<'server role name'>] DROP MEMBER <'user name'>
GO

Provide administrators with separate accounts for administration and regular accounts for non-administrator activity."

  desc 'SQL Server backups are a critical step in maintaining data assurance and availability.

User-level information is data generated by information system and/or application users. In order to assure availability of this data in the event of a system failure, DoD organizations are required to ensure user generated data is backed up at a defined frequency. This includes data stored on file systems, within SQL Server or within any other storage media.

Applications performing backups must be capable of backing up user-level information per the DoD defined frequency.

Databases that do not backup information regularly risk the loss of that information in the event of a system failure.'

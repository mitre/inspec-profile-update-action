Unauthorized changes to these parameters could lead to a compromise of the database security posture.

Review the file permissions on the Binary initialization parameter file (the default name is spfile[SID].ora).

Binary initialization parameter files are by default located in the $ORACLE_HOME/dbs directory (UNIX) or %ORACLE_HOME%\\database directory (Windows).    

From SQL*Plus:
  select value from v$parameter where name = 'spfile';
  select member from v$logfile;
  select name from v$datafile;  
  select name from v$controlfile;
  
Check directory and file permissions for the files returned by the SQL commands above, for the files located in the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory (UNIX) or %ORACLE_HOME%\\network\\admin directory (Windows) and the directory specified by the TNS_ADMIN environment variable, if defined.

On UNIX systems:

  ls â€“ld [pathname]

If permissions are granted for world access, this is a Finding.

If any groups that include members other than the Oracle process and software owner accounts, DBAs, auditors, or backup accounts are listed, this is a Finding.

On Windows Systems (From Windows Explorer):

 Browse to the directory specified.

 Select and right-click on the directory, select Properties, select the Security tab.

If permissions are granted to everyone, this is a Finding.

If any accounts other than the Oracle process and software owner accounts, Administrators, DBAs, System groups, auditors, or backup accounts are listed, this is a Finding."

Set Windows permissions to Full Control assigned to the Administrators, the Oracle service account and DBAs.

Remove any unauthorized account access.'

  desc %q(In vSphere 6.7, the built-in "Administrator" role contains permission to perform cryptographic operations such as KMS functions and encrypting and decrypting virtual machine disks. This role must be reserved for cryptographic administrators where VM encryption and/or vSAN encryption is in use. 

A new built-in role called "No Cryptography Administrator" exists to provide all administrative permissions except cryptographic operations. Permissions must be restricted such that normal vSphere administrators are assigned the 'No Cryptography Administrator' role or more restrictive. 

The "Administrator" role must be tightly controlled and must not be applied to administrators who will not be doing cryptographic work. Catastrophic data loss can result from poorly administered cryptography.)

If there are any users other than Solution Users with the "Administrator" role that are not explicitly designated for cryptographic operations, this is a finding.'

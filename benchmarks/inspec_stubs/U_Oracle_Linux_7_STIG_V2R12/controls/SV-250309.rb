  desc 'Preventing non-privileged users from executing privileged functions mitigates the risk that unauthorized individuals or processes may gain unnecessary access to information or privileges.

Privileged functions include, for example, establishing accounts, performing system integrity checks, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals who do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users.'

Verify the operating system confines SELinux users to roles that conform to least privilege.

Check the SELinux User list to SELinux Roles mapping by using the following command:

$ sudo semanage user -l
SELinuxUser LabelingPrefix MLS/MCSLevel MLS/MCSRange SELinuxRoles
guest_u            user  s0  s0  guest_r
root                   user  s0  s0-s0:c0.c1023  staff_r sysadm_r system_r unconfined_r
staff_u              user  s0  s0-s0:c0.c1023  staff_r sysadm_r
sysadm_u         user  s0  s0-s0:c0.c1023  sysadm_r 
system_u          user  s0  s0-s0:c0.c1023  system_r unconfined_r
unconfined_u  user  s0  s0-s0:c0.c1023  system_r unconfined_r
user_u               user  s0  s0  user_r
xguest_u           user  s0  s0  xguest_r

If the output differs from the above example, ask the SA to demonstrate how the SELinux User mappings are exercising least privilege. If deviations from the example are not documented with the ISSO and do not demonstrate least privilege, this is a finding.'

Use the following command to map the "staff_u" SELinux user to the "staff_r" and "sysadm_r" roles:

$ sudo semanage user -m staff_u -R staff_r -R sysadm_r

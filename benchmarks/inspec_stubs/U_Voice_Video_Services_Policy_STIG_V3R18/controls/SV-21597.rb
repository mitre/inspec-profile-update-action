  title 'An uninterruptible power system (UPS) has not been designed or implemented to provide  sufficient continuous backup power for the LAN Infrastructure, WAN boundary Infrastructure, VVoIP infrastructure, and/or VVoIP endpoints as required in support of special-C2 and C2 users system availability needs during a power outage OR sufficient backup power is not provided to C2-R or non-C2/admin user accessible endpoints, minimally in support of emergency life-safety and security calls.'
  desc 'An uninterruptible power source for the LAN and VVoIP infrastructure is a necessity for the continued survivability, availability, and reliability of the VVoIP services. In traditional telecommunications systems the need for backup power is the same but it can be met generally at a single location, which is the phone switch location. The power required by the endpoints is generally provided by the phone switch to maintain basic dial tone services even though some “digital and feature phones require a local power supply. This is not possible in an IP/LAN based VVoIP network because the LAN infrastructure is geographically spread out to be within 100m cabling distance from each LAN endpoint. As such, the power, both primary and backup, must follow the NE to its location. Centrally located core equipment must also have a central uninterruptible power supply (UPS). The endpoints also need continuous power to maintain service. IP telephony endpoints require power to operate. This can be provided locally with a power brick (a small plug-in power adaptor/supply) and an AC outlet or can be provided by the LAN using Power Over Ethernet (POE) technologies. The UPS providing backup power to the LAN access switch can also provide backup power to the endpoint via POE if properly sized. If this is not the case, an individual UPS is required for each instrument supporting special C2 and C2 users of the proper capacity. Policy sets the minimum requirements for the backup power supplied to the VVoIP systems and the supporting LAN and VVoIP endpoints with emphasis on supporting C2 communications when primary power is lost. While this is a very valid case, it is also best practice, if not critical, to provide some level of backup power to the core systems, LAN, and endpoints that only support C2R and non-C2/admin users to support some level of reliable/survivable service, especially for emergency life-safety and security calls. NOTE: The requirement here for UPS support for C2R or Non-C2/admin users communications is negated in the event that such users have an alternate reliable means of communicating in such situations. Personal and potentially even government provided cell phones are not the answer since there are many locations in DoD facilities where they are prohibited and/or signal availability is unreliable. An alternative to this could be to put a policy and SOP into effect that requires such users to evacuate the facility to a location where the appropriate communications capability is available. The policy excerpts driving this requirement are as follows: From the UCR 5.3.1.7.5 Power Backup [Required: ASLAN – Conditional: Non-ASLAN] To meet CJCS requirements for assured services, equipment serving special C2 and C2 users must be provided with backup power. The ASLAN must meet the power requirements outlined at a minimum as follows: Special C2: The ASLAN must provide an 8-hour backup capability in the event of primary power loss to special C2 users. Any ASLAN product, Core, Distribution, or Access that supplies service to the special C2 user must have an 8-hour UPS. 2. C2: The ASLAN must provide 2 hour backup capability in the event of primary power loss to C2 users. Any ASLAN product, core, distribution or access, that supplies service to the C2 user must have a 2 hour uninterruptible power system (UPS). 3. C2(R) or Non-C2: C2(R) or non-C2 users may lose telephony service in the event of a power failure. NOTE: Backup Power (Environmental). The backup power system shall have the capacity to operate environmental systems needed to sustain continuous equipment operation. Power to the environmental systems may not need to be continuous. From CJCSI 6215.01C Appendix A Enclosure C Based on the GIG MA ICD requirements associated with availability and reliability, the following requirements shall be met by IP based RTS. (a) Availability requirement for equipment/software serving Special C2 users is 0.99999 with eight hours uninterrupted power supply. (b) Availability requirement for equipment/software serving C2 users is 0.99997 with two hours uninterrupted power supply. (c) Availability requirement for equipment/software serving C2 users that are authorized to originate Routine ONLY (C2R) and non C2/admin users is 0.999 with no uninterrupted power supply. NOTE: While current DoD policy dictates that the VVoIP system as a whole only provide C2 and C2R users with specific durations of continued service during a power failure (as a cost saving measure), it is highly recommended that the entire system be provided some level of UPS. Traditional phone service is generally always available in a power failure since the endpoint or subscriber instrument is powered from the telephone switch. While there are exceptions to this regarding feature phones and some digital phones that need local power, for the most part all analog phones and others powered by the switch always work when local power is out. As noted above, VVoIP service is subject to disruption if power to the LAN infrastructure is disrupted. This can happen at various points since the LAN is a distributed (non-centralized) network. When implementing a VVoIP system without considering UPS power needs for the VVoIP controllers and endpoints as well as entire LAN, and supporting those needs with UPSs, we are reducing the availability of the telecommunications service that we are accustomed to.'
  desc 'check', 'Interview the IAO to confirm compliance with the following requirement: 
Ensure an uninterruptible power supply (battery at a minimum; plus optional generator) is provided for all parts of the VVoIP infrastructure (Core LSC/MFSS, adjunct systems providing critical services, EBC, CER,  LAN NEs, and endpoints as follows:
> All VVoIP system devices including voice endpoints and portions of the LAN that directly support any single special-C2 user are minimally provided 8 hours UPS.
> All VVoIP system devices including voice endpoints and portions of the LAN that directly supports any single C2 user are minimally provided 2 hours UPS.
> All VVoIP system devices including voice endpoints and portions of the LAN that supports C2R and non-C2/admin users (that is the balance of the VVoIP system) are provided some reasonable level (minimum 15 minutes / target 30 to 60 minutes) of UPS in support of emergency life-safety and security communications. 
> UPS systems supplying power to infrastructure that supports special-C2 and C2 users must also support environmental power (for example cooling power) such that equipment failures are prevented. This support may not need to be continuous but must be commensurate with the users supported (8 or 2hrs as appropriate).
UPS.

NOTE: UPS in support of C2R and non-C2/admin users’ endpoints is best provided using POE particularly if supporting the general population. (Probably more cost effective than a battery under every desk). While support of all such endpoints and infrastructure is desirable since this provides greater availability, the cost could become a negating factor. In this case, a portion of the regular endpoints or emergency use endpoints could be provided at strategic locations within the facility to fulfill the requirement to support emergency life-safety and security communications. 

Determine if the LAN supports Special-C2 or C2 users. If so, determine which part (or parts) of the LAN directly supports these users. Determine the method by which C2R and non-C2/admin users’ emergency life-safety and security communications are supported.  

This is a finding in the event, based on the interview; consideration has not been given to all aspects of backup power as described in the requirement. 

This finding carries a severity of Cat II if the requirements supporting a Special-C2 or C2 user are deficient. This finding carries a severity of Cat III if the requirements supporting C2R or Non-C2/admin users are deficient.

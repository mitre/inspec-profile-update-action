Review documented and implemented procedures for monitoring the Oracle DBMS job/batch queues for unauthorized submissions. If procedures for job queue review are not defined, documented or evidence of implementation does not exist, this is a Finding.

Job queue information is available from the DBA_JOBS view. The following command lists jobs submitted to the queue. DBMS_JOB does not generate a 'history' of previous job executions.

Run this query:
select job, next_date, next_sec, failures, broken from dba_jobs;

Scheduler queue information is available from the DBA_SCHEDULER_JOBS view. The following command lists jobs submitted to the queue.

Run this query:
select owner, job_name, state, job_class, job_type, job_action

Develop, document and implement a formal migration plan to convert jobs using DBMS_JOB to use DBMS_SCHEDULER instead for Oracle versions 10.1 and higher.  (This does not apply to DBMS_JOB jobs generated by Oracle itself, such as those for refreshing materialized views.)

Set the value of the job_queue_processes parameter to a low value to restrict concurrent DBMS_JOB executions.

Use auditing to capture use of the DBMS_JOB package in the audit trail. Review the audit trail for unauthorized use of the DBMS_JOB package.'

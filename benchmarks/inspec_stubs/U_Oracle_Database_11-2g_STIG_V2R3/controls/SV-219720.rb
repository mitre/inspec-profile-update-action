Application data should be stored separately from system and custom user-defined objects to facilitate administration and management of its data storage. The SYSTEM tablespace should never be used for application data storage in order to prevent resource contention and performance degradation.'

select distinct owner, tablespace_name

order by tablespace_name;

(With respect to the list of special accounts that are excluded from this requirement, it is expected that the DBA will maintain the list to suit local circumstances, adding special accounts as necessary and removing any that are not supposed to be in use in the Oracle deployment that is under review.)

Review the list of returned table owners with the tablespace used.

If any of the owners listed are not default Oracle accounts and use the SYSTEM or any other tablespace not dedicated for the applicationâ€™s use, this is a Finding.

Look for multiple applications that may share a tablespace.

If no records were returned, ask the DBA if any applications use this database.

If no applications use the database, this is not a Finding.

If there are applications that do use the database or if the application uses the SYS or other default account and SYSTEM tablespace to store its objects, this is a Finding.'

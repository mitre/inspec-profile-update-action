  title 'The EDB Postgres Advanced Server must provide centralized configuration of the content to be captured in audit records generated by all components of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server.'
  desc "If the configuration of the DBMS's auditing is spread across multiple locations in the database management software, or across multiple commands, only loosely related, it is harder to use and takes longer to reconfigure in response to events.

The DBMS must provide a unified tool for audit configuration."

Review the system documentation for a description of how audit records are off-loaded and how local audit log space is managed.'

  title 'Installation of compilers on production web servers is prohibited.'
  desc 'The presence of a compiler on a production server facilitates the malicious userâ€™s task of creating custom versions of programs and installing Trojan Horses or viruses.'
  desc 'check', "Using Windows Explorer and/or add-remove programs, search the system for the existence of known compilers, such as, msc.exe, msvc.exe, Python.exe, javac.exe, Lcc-win32.exe, or equivalent.

If a compiler is found on the production server, this is a finding.

NOTE:  If the web server is part of an application suite and a compiler is needed for installation, patching, and upgrading of the suite or if the compiler is embedded and can't be removed without breaking the suite, document the installation of the compiler with the ISSO/ISSM and verify that the compiler is restricted to administrative users only.  If documented and restricted to administrative users, this is not a finding."

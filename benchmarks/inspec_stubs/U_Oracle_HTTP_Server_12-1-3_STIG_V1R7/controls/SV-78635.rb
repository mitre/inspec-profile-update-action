Even when data appears to be static, the non-displayed logic in a web page may expose business logic or trusted system relationships. The integrity of all the data being exchanged between the user and web server must always be trusted. To protect the integrity and trust, encryption methods should be used to protect the complete communication session.'

2. Search for the following directive at the OHS server, virtual host, and/or directory configuration scopes:
"SSLEngine"
"SSLProtocol"
"SSLWallet"

3. If any of these directives are omitted, this is a finding.

5. Validate that the folder specified in the "SSLWallet" directive exists. If the folder does not exist or contain a valid wallet, this is a finding.'

  desc 'Data used to authenticate, especially passwords, needs to be protected at all times, and encryption is the standard method for protecting authentication data during transmission. Data used to authenticate can be passed to and from the web server for many reasons. 

Examples include data passed from a user to the web server through an HTTPS connection for authentication, the web server authenticating to a backend database for data retrieval and posting, and the web server authenticating to a clustered web server manager for an update.'

Note: Does not apply to admin.conf.

2. Search for the following directive at the OHS server, virtual host, and/or directory configuration scopes:
"SSLEngine"
"SSLProtocol"
"SSLWallet"

3. If any of these directives are omitted, this is a finding.

4. If "SSLEngine" is not set to "On" or "SSLProtocol" is not set to "TLS versions 1.1 and greater", this is a finding.

5. Validate that the folder specified in the "SSLWallet" directive exists. If the folder does not exist or contain a valid wallet, this is a finding.'

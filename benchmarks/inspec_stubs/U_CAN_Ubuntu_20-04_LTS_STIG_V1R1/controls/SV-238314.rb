  desc 'Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.  
 
Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).'

always,exit -F arch=b64 -S delete_module -k modules 
 
If the command does not return lines that matches the example or the lines are commented out, this is a finding. 
 
Notes: 
- For 32-bit architectures, only the 32-bit specific output lines from the commands are required. 
- The "-k" allows for specifying an arbitrary identifier, and the string after it does not need to match the example output above.'

  desc "The report generation function must support on-demand review and analysis to facilitate the organization's ability to generate incident reports as needed to better handle larger-scale or more complex security incidents. 

On-demand reporting allows personnel to report issues more rapidly to more effectively meet reporting requirements. Collecting log data and aggregating it to present the data in a single, consolidated report achieves this objective."

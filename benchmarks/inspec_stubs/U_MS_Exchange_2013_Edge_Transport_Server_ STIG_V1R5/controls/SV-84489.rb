  desc 'Spam origination sites and other sources of suspected email-borne malware have the ability to corrupt, compromise, or otherwise limit availability of email servers. Limiting exposure to unfiltered inbound messages can reduce the risk of spam and malware impacts. 

The Global Deny list blocks messages originating from specific sources. Most blacklist filtering is done using a commercial Block List service, because eliminating threats from known spammers prevents the messages being evaluated inside the enclave where there is more risk they can do harm. 

Additional sources should also be blocked to supplement the contents of the commercial Block List service. For example, during a zero-day threat action, entries can be added and then removed when the threat is mitigated. An additional best practice is to enter the enterpriseâ€™s home domains in the Deny List, because inbound email with a "from" address of the home domain is very likely to be spoofed spam.'

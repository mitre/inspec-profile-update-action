  title 'The DBN-6300 must provide audit record generation capability for DoD-defined auditable events within the DBN-6300.'
  desc 'Without the capability to generate audit records, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one. 

Audit records can be generated from various components within the network device (e.g., process, module). Certain specific device functionalities may be audited as well. The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is capable of generating audit records.

DoD has defined the list of events for which the device will provide an audit record generation capability as the following: 

(i) Successful and unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete privileges, security objects, security levels, or categories of information (e.g., classification levels);
(ii) Access actions, such as successful and unsuccessful logon attempts, privileged activities or other system level access, starting and ending time for user access to the system, concurrent logons from different workstations, successful and unsuccessful accesses to objects, all program initiations, and all direct access to the information system; and
(iii) All account creation, modification, disabling, and termination actions.

With the DB-6300, audit records are automatically backed up on a real-time basis via syslog when enabled.'
  desc 'check', 'Verify the DBN-6300 is connected to the syslog server.

Navigate to Settings >> Advanced >> Syslog.

Verify that the syslog services are set to "on", the syslog server information is valid, and the syslog server has connected.

Navigate to Settings >> Advanced >> Audit Log.

Verify that the Audit Syslog, "Use System Syslog" button is set to "Yes" and that the Audit Configuration Categories are all checked for Audit Log, Syslog, and Audit Console.

Following this verification, process any account function. Confirm the presence of a syslog message on the syslog server containing the information for whatever that account function represented.

If the DBN-6300 is not connected to the syslog server, or if the syslog server is connected but the message containing the information for the account action that took place is not present, this is a finding.'
  desc 'fix', 'Configure the DBN-6300 to be connected to the syslog server. Also configure the DBN-6300 to include audit records in the syslog message feed.

Navigate to Settings >> Advanced >> Syslog.

Enter the syslog connection information (port and IP address) and push the "enabled" button for both "TCP" and "enable".

Navigate to Settings >> Advanced >> Audit Log.

Verify that the Audit Syslog, "Use System Syslog" button is set to "Yes" and that the Audit Configuration Categories are all checked for Audit Log, Syslog, and Audit Console.

If the "Use System Syslog" button is not set to "Yes", press the "Yes" button.

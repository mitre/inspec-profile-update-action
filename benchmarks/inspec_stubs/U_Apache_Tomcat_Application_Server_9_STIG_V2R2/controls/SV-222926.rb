Access to the manager application must be limited and that includes the number of sessions allowed to access the management application. A balance must be struck between the number of simultaneous connections allowed to the management application and the number of authorized admins requiring access at any given time.

Determine the number of authorized admins requiring simultaneous access and increase the number of allowed simultaneous sessions by a small percentage in order to help prevent potential lockouts.

Document that value in the System Security Plan (SSP).'

From the Tomcat server as an elevated user run the following command:

If the maxActiveSesions setting is not configured according to the number of connections defined in the SSP, this is a finding.'

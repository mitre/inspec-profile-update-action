  desc 'Keeping the IDPS software updated with the latest engine and attack signatures will allow for the IDPS to detect all forms of known attacks.  Not maintaining the IDPS properly could allow for attacks to go unnoticed.'
  desc 'check', 'Interview the ISSO and the IDPS administrator. Have the IDPS administrator display update notifications that have been received, the build number or patch level, then search the vendorâ€™s vulnerability database for current release and patch level.

If software and signatures are not updated when updates are provided by the vendor, this is a finding.'

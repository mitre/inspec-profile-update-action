If the service is running with the default authenticators, anyone can gather data about the system and the network and use the information to potentially compromise the integrity of the system or network(s). It is highly recommended that SNMP version 3 user authentication and message encryption be used in place of the version 2 community strings.'

If the file does not exist, this is Not Applicable.

If the file does exist, check for the default community strings with the following commands:

# grep public /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf
# grep private /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf

If either of these commands returns any output, this is a finding.'

  desc 'check', %q(If the "firewalld" package is not installed, ask the System Administrator (SA) if another firewall application (such as iptables) is installed. If an application firewall is not installed, this is a finding. 

Verify the system's access control program is configured to grant or deny system access to specific hosts.

Check to see if "firewalld" is active with the following command:

# systemctl status firewalld
firewalld.service - firewalld - dynamic firewall daemon
Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/firewalld.service; enabled)
Active: active (running) since Sun 2014-04-20 14:06:46 BST; 30s ago

If "firewalld" is active, check to see if it is configured to grant or deny access to specific hosts or services with the following commands:

# firewall-cmd --get-default-zone
public

# firewall-cmd --list-all --zone=public
public (active)
target: default
icmp-block-inversion: no
interfaces: eth0
sources:
services: mdns ssh
ports:
protocols:
masquerade: no
forward-ports:
icmp-blocks:

If "firewalld" is not active, determine whether "tcpwrappers" is being used by checking whether the "hosts.allow" and "hosts.deny" files are empty with the following commands:

# ls -al /etc/hosts.allow
rw-r----- 1 root root 9 Aug 2 23:13 /etc/hosts.allow

# ls -al /etc/hosts.deny
-rw-r----- 1 root root 9 Apr 9 2007 /etc/hosts.deny

If "firewalld" and "tcpwrappers" are not installed, configured, and active, ask the SA if another access control program (such as iptables) is installed and active. Ask the SA to show that the running configuration grants or denies access to specific hosts or services.

If "firewalld" is active and is not configured to grant access to specific hosts or "tcpwrappers" is not configured to grant or deny access to specific hosts, this is a finding.)
  desc 'fix', 'If "firewalld" is installed and active on the system, configure rules for allowing specific services and hosts.

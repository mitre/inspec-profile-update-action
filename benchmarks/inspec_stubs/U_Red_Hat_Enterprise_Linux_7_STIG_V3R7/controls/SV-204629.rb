Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/ipsec.service; disabled)
Active: inactive (dead)

If the "IPsec" service is active, check to see if any tunnels are configured in "/etc/ipsec.conf" and "/etc/ipsec.d/" with the following commands:

# grep -iw conn /etc/ipsec.conf /etc/ipsec.d/*.conf

If there are indications that a "conn" parameter is configured for a tunnel, ask the System Administrator if the tunnel is documented with the ISSO. 

If "libreswan" is installed, "IPsec" is active, and an undocumented tunnel is active, this is a finding.'

Time stamps generated by the web server include date and time and must be to a granularity of one second.

Like all web servers, tc Server logs can be configured to produce a Common Log Format (CLF). The tc Server component known as an AccessLogValve, which represents a component that can be inserted into the request processing pipeline to capture user interaction. The Access Log Valve should be configured to ensure that investigators have sufficient information to conduct an appropriate audit.'

tail /storage/log/vmware/vco/app-server/localhost_access_log.txt

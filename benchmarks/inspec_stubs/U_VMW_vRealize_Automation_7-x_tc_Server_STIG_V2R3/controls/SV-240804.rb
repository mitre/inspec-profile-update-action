  desc 'The DoD standard for authentication is DoD-approved PKI certificates. A certificateâ€™s certification path is the path from the end entity certificate to a trusted root certification authority (CA). Certification path validation is necessary for a relying party to make an informed decision regarding acceptance of an end entity certificate. Certification path validation includes checks such as certificate issuer trust, time validity and revocation status for each certificate in the certification path. Revocation status information for CA and subject certificates in a certification path is commonly provided via certificate revocation lists (CRLs) or online certificate status protocol (OCSP) responses.'

Interview the ISSO.

Review tc Server ALL configuration to verify that certificates being provided by the client are being validated in accordance with RFC 5280.

If certificates are not being validated in accordance with RFC 5280, this is a finding.'

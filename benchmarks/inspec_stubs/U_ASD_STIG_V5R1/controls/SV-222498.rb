Identify the application components and the logs associated with the components.

Identify where clock settings are configured within the application.

Access the configuration settings and determine if the application is configured to set the time stamps for audit records according to UTC or GMT (e.g., East coast standard time is represented as GMT -5, east coast daylight savings time is represented as GMT-4).

If the application is not configured to map to UTC or GMT, this is a finding.'

Review the access control list (ACL) or filter for the router receive path.

Verify that only traffic sourced from the OOBM network or the NOC is allowed to access the router.

If the router does not block any traffic destined to itself that is not sourced from the OOBM network or the NOC, this is a finding.

Note: If the platform does not support the receive path filter, verify that all non-OOBM interfaces have an ingress ACL to restrict access to that interface address or any of the routerâ€™s loopback addresses to only traffic sourced from the management network. An exception would be to allow packets destined to these interfaces used for troubleshooting, such as ping and traceroute.'

Ensure that traffic from the managed network is not able to access the OOBM gateway router using either receive path or interface ingress ACLs.'

  title 'Windows Server 2019 must employ automated mechanisms to determine the state of system components with regard to flaw remediation using the following frequency: continuously, where Host Based Security System (HBSS) is used; 30 days, for any additional internal network scans not covered by HBSS; and annually, for external scans by Computer Network Defense Service Provider (CNDSP).'
  desc 'Without the use of automated mechanisms to scan for security flaws on a continuous and/or periodic basis, the operating system or other system components may remain vulnerable to the exploits presented by undetected software flaws. The operating system may have an integrated solution incorporating continuous scanning using HBSS and periodic scanning using other tools.'
  desc 'check', 'Verify DoD approved HBSS software is installed, configured, and properly operating. Ask the operator to document the HBSS software installation and configuration.

If the operator is not able to provide a documented configuration for an installed HBSS or if the HBSS software is not properly configured, maintained, or used, this is a finding.'
  desc 'fix', 'Install a DoD approved HBSS software and ensure it is operating continuously.'

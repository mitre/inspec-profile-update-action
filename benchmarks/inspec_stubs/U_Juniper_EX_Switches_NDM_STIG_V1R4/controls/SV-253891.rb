  desc 'To compile an accurate risk assessment and provide forensic analysis, it is essential for security personnel to know where events occurred, such as device hardware components, device software modules, session identifiers, filenames, host names, and functionality.

Associating information about where the event occurred within the network device provides a means of investigating an attack; recognizing resource utilization or capacity thresholds; or identifying an improperly configured device.'

Junos standard event log messages are configurable for time format, inclusion of logging facility and severity levels, and format. Setting "structured-data" automatically includes "explicit-priority" and "time-format year millisecond". Verify logging is enabled.

Note: In the example, events sent to the first external syslog server include the year and time is expressed in milliseconds. The second syslog server and the file both include the year, but time is expressed in seconds.

If the network device does not produce audit records containing information to establish where the events occurred, this is a finding.)

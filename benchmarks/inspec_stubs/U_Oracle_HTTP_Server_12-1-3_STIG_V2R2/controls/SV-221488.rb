2. Search for the following directive at the OHS server, virtual host, and/or directory configuration scopes:
"SSLEngine"
"SSLProtocol"
"SSLWallet"

3. If any of these directives are omitted, this is a finding.

4. If "SSLEngine" is not set to "On", or "SSLProtocol" is not set to "TLSv1.2", this is a finding.

5. Validate that the folder specified in the "SSLWallet" directive exists. If the folder does not exist or contain a valid wallet, this is a finding.'

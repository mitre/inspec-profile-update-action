  title 'OHS must have a log file defined for each site/virtual host to capture sufficient information to establish what type of events occurred.'
  desc 'Web server logging capability is critical for accurate forensic analysis. Without sufficient and accurate information, a correct replay of the events cannot be determined. 

Ascertaining the correct type of event that occurred is important during forensic analysis. The correct determination of the event and when it occurred is important in relation to other events that happened at that same time. 

Without sufficient information establishing what type of log event occurred, investigation into the cause of event is severely hindered. Log record content that may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this control includes, but is not limited to, time stamps, source and destination IP addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, application-specific events, success/fail indications, file names involved, access control, or flow control rules invoked.'

2. Search for the "CustomLog" directive at the OHS server and virtual host configuration scopes.

3. If the directive is omitted or set improperly, this is a finding unless inherited from a larger scope.

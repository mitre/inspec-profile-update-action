control 'SV-206565' do
  title 'The DBMS must invalidate session identifiers upon user logout or other session termination.'
  desc %q(Captured sessions can be reused in "replay" attacks. This requirement limits the ability of adversaries to capture and continue to employ previously valid session IDs.

This requirement focuses on communications protection for the DBMS session rather than for the network packet. The intent of this control is to establish grounds for confidence at each end of a communications session in the ongoing identity of the other party and in the validity of the information being transmitted. 

Session IDs are tokens generated by DBMSs to uniquely identify a user's (or process's) session. DBMSs will make access decisions and execute logic based on the session ID.

Unique session IDs help to reduce predictability of said identifiers. Unique session IDs address man-in-the-middle attacks, including session hijacking or insertion of false information into a session. If the attacker is unable to identify or guess the session information related to pending application traffic, they will have more difficulty in hijacking the session or otherwise manipulating valid sessions. 

When a user logs out, or when any other session termination event occurs, the DBMS must terminate the user session(s) to minimize the potential for sessions to be hijacked.)
  desc 'check', 'Review DBMS settings and vendor documentation to verify user sessions are terminated, and session identifiers invalidated, upon user logout. If they are not, this is a finding.

Review system documentation and organization policy to identify other events that should result in session terminations.

If other session termination events are defined, review DBMS settings to verify occurrences of these events would cause session termination, invalidating the session identifiers.

If occurrences of defined session terminating events do not cause session terminations, invalidating the session identifiers, this is a finding.'

  desc 'Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel within a network and between interconnected networks. Blocking or restricting detected harmful or suspicious communications between interconnected networks enforces approved authorizations for controlling the flow of traffic.

The firewall that filters traffic outbound to interconnected networks with different security policies must be configured with filters (i.e., rules, access control lists [ACLs], screens, and policies) that permit, restrict, or block traffic based on organization-defined traffic authorizations. Filtering must include packet header and packet attribute information, such as IP addresses and port numbers.

Configure filters to perform certain actions when packets match specified attributes, including the following actions:

- Apply a policy
- Accept, reject, or discard the packets
- Classify the packets based on their source address
- Evaluate the next term in the filter
- Increment a packet counter
- Set the packetsâ€™ loss priority
- Specify an IPsec SA (if IPsec is used in the implementation)
- Specify the forwarding path
- Write an alert or message to the system log.'

The {} indicate the object is defined by the organization policy. The firewall performs IP integrity header checking on all incoming packets to verify if the protocol packet is a valid TCP, UDP, ICMP, SCTP, or GRE length. Stateful inspection is done to verify TCP SYN and FIN flags are set as needed.'

  desc "Malicious code protection mechanisms include but are not limited to anti-virus and malware detection software. To minimize potential negative impact to the organization that can be caused by malicious code, it is imperative that malicious code is identified and eradicated. 

Malicious code includes viruses, worms, trojan horses, and spyware. It is not enough to have the software installed; this software must periodically scan the system to search for malware on an organization-defined frequency. 

Exchange's built-in Malware Agent is not designed to address all malicious code protection workloads.Â This workload is best handled by third-party anti-virus and intrusion prevention software.

Sites must use an approved DoD scanner. Exchange Malware software has a limited scanning capability and does not scan files that are downloaded, opened, or executed."

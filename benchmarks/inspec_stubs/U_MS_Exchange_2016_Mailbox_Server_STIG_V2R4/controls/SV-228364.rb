  desc 'It is detrimental for applications to provide, or install by default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may remain unsecured. They increase the risk to the platform by providing additional attack vectors.

Applications are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions).

Examples of non-essential capabilities include but are not limited to advertising software or browser plug-ins not related to requirements or providing a wide array of functionality not required for every mission but that cannot be disabled.

All system errors in Exchange will result in outbound traffic that may be identified by an eavesdropper. For this reason, the "Report Fatal Errors to Microsoft" feature must be disabled.'

Note: The <IdentityName> value must be in single quotes.

Repeat the process for each Exchange Server."

This validation procedure is performed on both the MDM Administration Console and the Samsung Android 8 with Knox device.

On the MDM console, do the following:
1. Ask the MDM Administrator to display the "Allow calendar info outside CONTAINER" setting in the "Android Knox CONTAINER >> CONTAINER Restrictions" rule. 
2. Verify the setting is disabled.

On the Samsung Android 8 with Knox device, do the following:
1. Open the Knox CONTAINER.
2. Select "Workspace settings".
3. Select "Notifications and data".
4. Select "Contacts and Calendar".
5. Verify "Export to Personal Mode â€“ Calendar (from Workspace)" (on some devices, shown as "Export to Personal Mode - S Planner") is disabled and attempt to enable this setting.

If the MDM console "Allow calendar info outside CONTAINER" is not set to disabled or on the Samsung Android 8 with Knox device, the user can enable this setting, this is a finding.'

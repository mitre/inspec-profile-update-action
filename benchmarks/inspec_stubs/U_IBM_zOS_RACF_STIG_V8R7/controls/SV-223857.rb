RACF userid groups, and started tasks that use z/OS UNIX facilities are defined to an ACP with attributes including UID and GID. If these attributes are not correctly defined, data access or command privilege controls could be compromised.'

Listgrp * OMVS

If each group is defined with a unique GID, this is not a finding.

Note: A site can choose to have both an OMVSGRP group and an STCOMVS group or combine the groups under one of these names.

If OMVSGRP and/or STCOMVS groups are defined and have a unique GID in the range of 1-99, this is not a finding.'

Define the OMVSGRP group and/or the STCOMVS group to the security database with a unique GID in the range of 1-99.

OMVSGRP is the name suggested by IBM for all the required userids. STCOMVS is the standard name used at some sites for the userids that are associated with z/OS UNIX started tasks and daemons. These groups can be combined at the siteâ€™s discretion.'

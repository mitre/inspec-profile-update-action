  desc 'Data on mobile devices is protected by numerous mechanisms, including user authentication, access control, and cryptography. When the data is backed up to an external system (either locally connected or cloud-based), many if not all of these mechanisms are no longer present. This leaves the backed-up data vulnerable to attack. Disabling backup to external systems mitigates this risk.

This validation procedure is performed on both the EMM Administration console and the Android 11 device. 

On the EMM console:
1. Open "Device owner management" section.
2. Verify that "Enable backup service" is toggled to "Off".
3. Open "User restrictions on parent".
4. Verify that "Disallow usb file transfer" is toggled to "On".

On the Microsoft Android 11 device:
1. Plug a USB cable into Android 11 device and connect to a non-DOD network-managed PC. 
2. Go to Settings >> Connected devices >> USB.
3. Ensure â€œNo data transfer" is selected.

If the EMM console device policy is not set to disable the capability to back up to a locally connected system or on the Android 11 device, the device policy is not set to disable the capability to back up to a locally connected system, this is a finding.'

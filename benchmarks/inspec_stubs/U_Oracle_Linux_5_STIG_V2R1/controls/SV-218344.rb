  desc 'If start-up files execute world-writable programs, especially in unprotected directories, they could be maliciously modified to become trojans that destroy user files or otherwise compromise the system at the user, or higher, level.  If the system is compromised at the user level, it is much easier to eventually compromise the system at the root and network level.'

View the password file to determine where the home directories for users are:

# more /etc/passwd

Once the directory for the human users is determined, grep for the lists of world writable files and directories within the usersâ€™ home directories.

An example would be:

# grep /opt/app/bin/daemon /home/*/.*

where /home is the directory for the human users on the system and /opt/app/bin/daemon is a world writable file.'

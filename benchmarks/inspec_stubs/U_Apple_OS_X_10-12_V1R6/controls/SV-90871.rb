Explicit privileges (escalated or administrative privileges) provide the regular user with explicit capabilities and control that exceeds the rights of a regular user.

Operating system functionality will vary, and while users are not permitted to install unapproved software, there may be instances where the organization allows the user to install approved software packages, such as from an approved software repository.

The operating system or software configuration management utility must enforce control of software installation by users based upon what types of software installations are permitted (e.g., updates and security patches to existing software) and what types of installations are prohibited (e.g., software whose pedigree with regard to being potentially malicious is unknown or suspect) by the organization.'

/usr/sbin/system_profiler SPConfigurationProfileDataType | /usr/bin/grep "familyControlsEnabled = 1;"

Next, check that a blacklist has been properly configured for the user's home directories with the following command:

Remote access is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

Automated monitoring of remote access sessions allows organizations to detect cyber attacks and also ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies by auditing connection activities of remote access capabilities, such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), on a variety of information system components (e.g., servers, workstations, notebook computers, smartphones, and tablets).'

If the DELETE statement is not coded or commented out for production system, this is not a finding.

If the SMFCONFIG statement is coded with (at least) the FTPCLIENT and TN3270CLIENT operands, this is not a finding.

TCPCONFIG coded with TTLS â€“ Specifies that the AT-TLS function is activated for the TCP/IP stack. The AT-TLS function provides invocation of System SSL in the TCP transport layer of the stack. 

Note: If AT-TLS is enabled, you must activate the SERVAUTH class, define the INITSTACK resource profile, and permit users to it.

To determine if an audit is configured, execute the following script. 
Run this TSQL command to determine if SQL Auditing AuditActionGroups are configured:
  SELECT DISTINCT sd.audit_action_name 
  FROM sys.database_audit_specification_details sd
  JOIN sys.database_audit_specifications s 
  ON s.database_specification_id = sd.database_specification_id

  AND s.is_state_enabled = 1
  ORDER BY sd.audit_action_name

If no values exist for AuditActionGroup, this is a finding. 

Verify the following AuditActionGroup(s) are configured:
SCHEMA_OBJECT_ACCESS_GROUP

If any listed AuditActionGroups do not exist in the configuration, this is a finding."

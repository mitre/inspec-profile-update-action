  title 'The container platform must record time stamps for audit records that meet a granularity of one second for a minimum degree of precision.'
  desc 'To properly investigate an event, it is important to have enough granularity within the time stamps to determine the chronological order of the audited events. Without this granularity, events may be interpreted out of proper sequence, thus hobbling the investigation or causing the investigation to come to inaccurate conclusions.

Time stamps generated by the container platform include date and time. Granularity of time measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between information system clocks and reference clocks.'
  desc 'check', 'Review the container platform documentation and configuration files to determine if time stamps for log records meet a granularity of one second. 

If the time stamp cannot generate to a one-second granularity, this is a finding.'

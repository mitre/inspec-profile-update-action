  title 'DB2 must generate audit records when privileges/permissions are deleted.'
  desc "Changes in the permissions, privileges, and roles granted to users and roles must be tracked. Without an audit trail, unauthorized elevation or restriction of individuals' and groups' privileges could go undetected. Elevated privileges give users access to information and functionality that they should not have; restricted privileges wrongly deny access to authorized users.

In an SQL environment, deleting permissions is typically done via the REVOKE  command."
  desc 'check', "To meet these requirements at the SECMAINT, CONTEXT category auditing needs to be implemented at database level. 

Run the following SQL statement to ensure that an audit policy is defined upon the database: 
DB2> SELECT AUDITPOLICYNAME, AUDITPOLICYID 
           FROM SYSCAT.AUDITUSE 
           WHERE OBJECTTYPE IN (' ')

If no rows are returned, this is a finding. 

Using the AUDITPOLICYID from above query find the details of audit policy: 
DB2> SELECT AUDITPOLICYNAME, CONTEXTSTATUS, SECMAINTSTATUS, ERRORTYPE AS ERRORTYPE 
           FROM SYSCAT.AUDITPOLICIES 
           WHERE AUDITPOLICYID = <audit policy ID>

If the values for CONTEXTSTATUS and SECMAINTSTATUS are not 'B' (Both) or ERRORTYPE is not 'A' (Audit), this is a finding."

DB2> CREATE AUDIT POLICY <DB audit policy name>

To modify an existing audit policy, replace "CREATE" with "ALTER" in the preceding statement. Only the categories explicitly named in the statement will be affected.  In this case, the changes take effect immediately.

If CREATE was used above, in the following command to apply the policy created above to the database: 
DB2> AUDIT DATABASE USING POLICY <DB audit policy name>'

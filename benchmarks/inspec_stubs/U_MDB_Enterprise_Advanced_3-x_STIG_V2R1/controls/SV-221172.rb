  title 'MongoDB must enforce authorized access to all PKI private keys stored/utilized by MongoDB.'
  desc "The DoD standard for authentication is DoD-approved PKI certificates. PKI certificate-based authentication is performed by requiring the certificate holder to cryptographically prove possession of the corresponding private key.

If the private key is stolen, an attacker can use the private key(s) to impersonate the certificate holder. In cases where MongoDB-stored private keys are used to authenticate MongoDB to the systemâ€™s clients, loss of the corresponding private keys would allow an attacker to successfully perform undetected man in the middle attacks against MongoDB system and its clients.

Both the holder of a digital certificate and the issuing authority must take careful measures to protect the corresponding private key. Private keys should always be generated and protected in FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules.

All access to the private key(s) of MongoDB must be restricted to authorized and authenticated users. If unauthorized users have access to one or more of MongoDB's private keys, an attacker could gain access to the key(s) and use them to impersonate the database on the network or otherwise perform unauthorized actions."

net:
ssl:
mode: requireSSL
PEMKeyFile: /etc/ssl/mongodb.pem
CAFile: /etc/ssl/mongodbca.pem

Verify ownership, group ownership, and permissions on the file given for PEMKeyFile (default 'mongodb.pem').

Run following command and review its output:
ls -al /etc/mongod.conf

typical output:

If the user owner is not "mongod", this is a finding.

If the group owner is not "mongod", this is a finding.

If the file is more permissive than "600", this is a finding.

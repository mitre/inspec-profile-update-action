  title 'Apple iOS/iPadOS 17 must require a valid password be successfully entered before the mobile device data is unencrypted.'
  desc 'Passwords provide a form of access control that prevents unauthorized individuals from accessing computing resources and sensitive data. Passwords may also be a source of entropy for generation of key encryption or data encryption keys. If a password is not required to access data, this data is accessible to any adversary who obtains physical possession of the device. Requiring that a password be successfully entered before the mobile device data is unencrypted mitigates this risk.

Note: MDF PP requires a Password Authentication Factor and requires management of its length and complexity. It leaves open whether theÂ  existence of a password is subject to management. This requirement addresses the configuration to require a password, which is critical to the cybersecurity posture of the device.

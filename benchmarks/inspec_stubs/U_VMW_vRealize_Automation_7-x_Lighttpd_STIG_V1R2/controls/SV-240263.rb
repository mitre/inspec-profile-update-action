Time stamps generated by the web server include date and time. Time is commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC.

In order to ensure that Lighttpd is correctly logging timestamps, the accesslog.format setting must be enabled.'

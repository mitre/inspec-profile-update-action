  desc 'Without the ability to centrally manage the content captured in the audit records, identification, troubleshooting, and correlation of suspicious behavior would be difficult and could lead to a delayed or incomplete analysis of an ongoing attack.

The content captured in audit records must be managed from a central location (necessitating automation). Centralized management of audit records and logs provides for efficiency in maintenance and management of records, as well as the backup and archiving of those records. 

The DBMS may write audit records to database tables, to files in the file system, to other kinds of local repository, or directly to a centralized log management system. Whatever the method used, it must be compatible with off-loading the records to the centralized system.'

     $db2audit describe 

If this filesystem location is not compatible with the centralized  audit management system, this is a finding.

If DB2 is not used in conjunction with a centralized audit management system, this is a finding.'

DB2 does not directly support syslog on windows.  Devise an alternate method of log capture."

Database functions and procedures can be coded using definer's rights. This allows anyone who utilizes the object to perform the actions if they were the owner. If not properly managed, this can lead to privileged actions being taken by unauthorized individuals.

Conversely, if critical tables or other objects rely on unauthorized owner accounts, these objects may be lost when an account is removed."

  title 'The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must audit all uses of the renameat syscall.'
  desc 'If the system is not configured to audit certain activities and write them to an audit log, it is more difficult to detect and track system compromises and damages incurred during a system compromise.

When a user logs on, the auid is set to the uid of the account that is being authenticated. Daemons are not user sessions and have the loginuid set to -1. The auid representation is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which equals 4294967295. The audit system interprets -1, 4294967295, and "unset" in the same way.

'

Check the file system rules in "/etc/audit/audit.rules" with the following commands:

# grep -iw renameat /etc/audit/audit.rules

-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S renameat -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k delete

-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S renameat -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k delete

If both the "b32" and "b64" audit rules are not defined for the "renameat" syscall, this is a finding.'

The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect.'

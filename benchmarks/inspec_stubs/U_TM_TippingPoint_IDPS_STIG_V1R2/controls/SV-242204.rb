  title 'The TPS must continuously monitor outbound communications traffic for unusual/unauthorized activities or conditions.'
  desc "If outbound communications traffic is not continuously monitored for unusual/unauthorized activities or conditions, there will be times when hostile activity may not be noticed and defended against. 

Although some of the components in the site's content scanning solution may be used for periodic scanning assessment, the IDPS sensors and other components must provide continuous, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week monitoring.

Unusual/unauthorized activities or conditions related to information system outbound communications traffic include, for example, internal traffic that indicates the presence of malicious code within organizational information systems or propagating among system components, the unauthorized exporting of information, or signaling to external information systems. Anomalies within organizational information systems include, for example, large file transfers, long-time persistent connections, use of unusual protocols and ports, and communications with suspected or known malicious external entities."

2. If there is not one configured, select "Default". 
3. Click "Edit Details". Ensure the deployment mode of "Default" is selected. The default deployment mode ensures all strict DoD vulnerabilities are blocked and alerted upon. 
4. Navigate to "Profile Overview" and ensure the action set for each category is set to "Recommended". The recommended action set is set to ensure all suspicious and vulnerable traffic is blocked and alerted upon. 

If the "default" deployment mode is not configured, this is a finding.

Note: If the site has set up a security profile (i.e., not using the default profile), then this should be inspected using the site's SSP for compliance.)

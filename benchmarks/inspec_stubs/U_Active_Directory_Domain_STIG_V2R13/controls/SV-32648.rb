RODC is considered part of the siteâ€™s Forest or Domain installation since it is not a standalone product, but rather a role of the the Windows AD DS full installation or Server Core installation. It is possible to have Windows 2003 clients authenticated using RODC, however, compatibility packs are needed. 

Note that RODC is not authorized for use across the site's perimeter firewall."

2. Verify that IPSec and other communications and security configurations for the management and replication of the RODC will be managed by use of the minimum required Group Policy Objects (GPOs).

3. Include an inspection of the RODC server in the DMZ when inspection for least privilege.

4. Verify that required patches and compatibility packs are installed if RODC is used with Windows 2003 (or earlier) clients.

5. If RODC server and configuration does not comply with requirements, then this is a finding.'

3. Replicate only the information needed to provide the functionality required. If full replication of all directory data is not needed, then replicated selective ID and authentication information as needed to the RODC.

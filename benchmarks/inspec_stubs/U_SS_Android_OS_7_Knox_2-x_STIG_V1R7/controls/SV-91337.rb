Review Samsung Android 7 with Knox configuration settings to determine if the mobile device is enforcing disabled sharing of calendar information outside the Container.

This validation procedure is performed on both the MDM Administration Console and the Samsung Android 7 with Knox device.

On the MDM console, do the following:
1. Ask the MDM administrator to display the "Allow calendar info outside container" setting in the "Android Knox Container >> Container Restrictions" rule. 
2. Verify the setting is disabled.

On the Samsung Android 7 with Knox device, do the following:
1. Open the Knox container.
2. Select "Knox Settings".
3. Select "Share contacts and calendars".
4. Verify "Export to Personal Mode â€“ Calendar (from Knox)" (on some devices, shown as "Export to Personal Mode - S Planner") is disabled and attempt to enable this setting.

If the MDM console "Allow calendar info outside container" is not set to disabled or on the Samsung Android 7 with Knox device, the user is able to enable this setting, this is a finding.'

Note: If the system does not have the GNOME Desktop installed, this requirement is Not Applicable.

Verify that the login screen user list for the GNOME Desktop is disabled with the following command:

     $ sudo grep -is disable-user-list /etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/*
     
     /etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/00-login-screen:disable-user-list=true

Create or edit the gdm profile in "/etc/dconf/profile/" to contain the following lines:

     $ sudo vi /etc/dconf/profile/gdm
	 
     user-db:user
     system-db:gdm
     file-db:/usr/share/gdm/greeter-dconf-defaults
	 
Create or edit the gdm database for machine-wide settings in "/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/" with the following lines:

     $ sudo vi /etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/00-login-screen
	 
     [org/gnome/login-screen]
     disable-user-list=true
	 
Update the system databases by updating the dconf utility:

     $ sudo dconf update
	 
If the login screen user list persists after updating the system databases, you can restart the GNOME Desktop without rebooting the system:

     $ sudo systemctl restart gdm'

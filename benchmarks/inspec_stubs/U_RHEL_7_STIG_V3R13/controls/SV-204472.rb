Check the group owner of all files and directories in a local interactive user's home directory with the following command:

Note: The example will be for the user "smithj", who has a home directory of "/home/smithj".

# ls -lLR /<home directory>/<users home directory>/
-rw-r--r-- 1 smithj smithj  18 Mar  5 17:06 file1
-rw-r--r-- 1 smithj smithj 193 Mar  5 17:06 file2
-rw-r--r-- 1 smithj sa        231 Mar  5 17:06 file3

If any files are found with an owner different than the group home directory user, check to see if the user is a member of that group with the following command:

# grep smithj /etc/group
sa:x:100:juan,shelley,bob,smithj 
smithj:x:521:smithj

If the user is not a member of a group that group owns file(s) in a local interactive user's home directory, this is a finding.)

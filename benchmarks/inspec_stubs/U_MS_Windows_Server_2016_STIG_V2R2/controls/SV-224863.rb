  desc 'Accounts or groups given rights on a system may show up as unresolved SIDs for various reasons including deletion of the accounts or groups.  If the account or group objects are reanimated, there is a potential they may still have rights no longer intended.  Valid domain accounts or groups may also show up as unresolved SIDs if a connection to the domain cannot be established for some reason.'
  desc 'check', 'Review the effective User Rights setting in Local Group Policy Editor.

Run "gpedit.msc".

Navigate to Local Computer Policy >> Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Local Policies >> User Rights Assignment.

Review each User Right listed for any unresolved SIDs to determine whether they are valid, such as due to being temporarily disconnected from the domain. (Unresolved SIDs have the format of "*S-1-â€¦".)

If any unresolved SIDs exist and are not for currently valid accounts or groups, this is a finding.

For server core installations, run the following command:

Secedit /export /areas USER_RIGHTS /cfg c:\\path\\UserRights.txt

The results in the file identify user right assignments by SID instead of group name. Review the SIDs for unidentified ones. A list of typical SIDs \\ Groups is below, search Microsoft for articles on well-known SIDs for others.

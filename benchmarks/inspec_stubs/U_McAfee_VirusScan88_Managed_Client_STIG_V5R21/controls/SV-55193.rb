Locally, on the client machine, use the Windows Explorer to navigate to the following folder: (This folder may be hidden.)
%SystemDrive%\\ProgramData\\McAfee\\Common Framework\\Task (64-Bit)

If folder(s) do not exist, an alternative method of validating is via the following registry key:
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\McAfee\\DesktopProtection\\Tasks] and are referenced by a GUID for each task.

Multiple .ini files will be stored in this folder, one for each task defined on the ePO server for this client. The name for each task is identified in the first section of the file under the [Task] section on the TaskName= "" line. Additionally, a TaskType= line is provided to describe the type of scan. In this case, TaskType=VSC700_Scan_Task is expected. Information for this check is determined by examining the contents of this file.

Criteria: If [Where] bSkipBootScan=0, this is not a finding.'

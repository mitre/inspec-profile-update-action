Time stamps generated by the Apache web server include date and time. Time is commonly expressed in UTC, a modern continuation of GMT, or local time with an offset from UTC.

Without sufficient granularity of time stamps, it is not possible to adequately determine the chronological order of records.

Determine the location of the "HTTPD_ROOT" directory and the "httpd.conf" file:

# httpd -V | egrep -i 'httpd_root|server_config_file'
-D HTTPD_ROOT="/etc/httpd"
-D SERVER_CONFIG_FILE="conf/httpd.conf"

Search for the "log_config_module" directive:

# cat /<path_to_file>/httpd.conf | grep -i "LogFormat"

Verify the "LogFormat" directive exists.

If the "LogFormat" directive does not exist, this is a finding.

Verify the "LogFormat" line contains the "%t" flag.
 
If "%t" flag is not present, time is not mapped to UTC or GMT time, this is a finding.)

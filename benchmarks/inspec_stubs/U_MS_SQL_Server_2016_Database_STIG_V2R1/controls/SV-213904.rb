Non-repudiation protects against later claims by a user of not having created, modified, or deleted a particular data item or collection of data in the database.

SQL Server provides the ability for high privileged accounts to impersonate users in a database using the TRUSTWORTHY feature.Â This will allow members of the fixed database role to impersonate any user within the database.'

If trustworthy is enabled and the database owner is a privileged account, review the system documentation to determine if the trustworthy property is required and authorized. If this is not documented, this is a finding."

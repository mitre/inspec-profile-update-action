  desc 'Determining the correct time a particular application event occurred on a system is critical when conducting forensic analysis and investigating system events. 
 
Periodically synchronizing internal clocks with an authoritative time source is necessary to correctly correlate the timing of events that occur across the enterprise. The three authoritative time sources for Google Android 11 are an authoritative time server that is synchronized with redundant United States Naval Observatory (USNO) time servers as designated for the appropriate DoD network (NIPRNet or SIPRNet), or the Global Positioning System (GPS), or the wireless carrier. 
 
Time stamps generated by the audit system in Google Android 11 must include both date and time. The time may be expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC.

2. Verify that "Disallow config date time" is toggled to On.
 
On the Google Android 11 device, do the following: 
1. Open Settings. 
2. Tap "System". 
3. Tap "Date & times". 
4. Validate that "Use network-provided time" is grayed out.

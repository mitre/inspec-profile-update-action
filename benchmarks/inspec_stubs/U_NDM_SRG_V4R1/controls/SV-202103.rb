  title 'The network device must record time stamps for audit records that meet a granularity of one second for a minimum degree of precision.'
  desc 'Without sufficient granularity of time stamps, it is not possible to adequately determine the chronological order of records. Time stamps generated by the application include date and time. Granularity of time measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between information system clocks and reference clocks.'
  desc 'check', 'Determine if the network device records time stamps for audit records that meet a granularity of one second for a minimum degree of precision.  This requirement may be verified by demonstration or configuration.

If the network device does not record time stamps for audit records that meet a granularity of one second for a minimum degree of precision, this is a finding.'
  desc 'fix', 'Configure the network device to record time stamps for audit records that meet a granularity of one second for a minimum degree of precision.'

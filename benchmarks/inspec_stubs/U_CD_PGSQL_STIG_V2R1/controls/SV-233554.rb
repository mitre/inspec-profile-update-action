Disconnection may be initiated by the user or forced by the system (as in a timeout) or result from a system or network failure. To the greatest extent possible, all disconnections must be logged."

First, log into the database with the postgres user by running the following commands:

$ sudo su - postgres
$ psql -U postgres

Next, as the database administrator, verify the log for a connection audit trail:

$ sudo su - postgres
$ cat ${PGDATA?}/${PGLOG?}/<latest_log>

  desc 'fix', %q(Note: The following instructions use the PGDATA and PGVER environment variables. See supplementary content APPENDIX-F for instructions on configuring PGDATA and APPENDIX-H for PGVER.

To ensure that logging is enabled, review supplementary content APPENDIX-C for instructions on enabling logging.

If logging is enabled the following configurations must be made to log connections, date/time, username, and session identifier.

First, as the database administrator (shown here as "postgres"), edit postgresql.conf by running the following:

$ sudo su - postgres
$ vi ${PGDATA?}/postgresql.conf

Edit the following parameters:

log_connections = on
log_disconnections = on
log_line_prefix = '< %m %u %c: >'

Where:
* %m is the time and date
* %u is the username
* %c is the session ID for the connection

Now, as the system administrator, reload the server with the new configuration:

$ sudo systemctl reload postgresql-${PGVER?})

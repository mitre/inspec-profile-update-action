This applies to all directories that contain scripts that can dynamically produce web pages in an interactive manner (i.e., scripts based upon user-provided input). Such scripts contain information that could be used to compromise a web service, access system resources, or deface a web site.'

Using ls â€“al, examine the file permissions on the CGI, the cgi-bin, and the cgi-shl directories.

Anonymous FTP users must not have access to these directories.

If the CGI, the cgi-bin, or the cgi-shl directories can be accessed by any group that does not require access, this is a finding.'

  title 'Restricted Area and Controlled Area Designation of Areas Housing Critical Information System Components or Classified /Sensitive Technology or Data'
  desc 'Failure to designate the areas housing the critical information technology systems as a restricted or controlled access area may result in inadequate protection being assigned during emergency actions or the site having insufficient physical security protection measures in place.  Further, warning signs may not be in place to advise visitors or other unauthorized persons that such areas are off-limits, resulting in inadvertent access by unauthorized persons.

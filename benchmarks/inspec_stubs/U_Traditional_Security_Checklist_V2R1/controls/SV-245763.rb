  desc 'check', 'BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Compelling reasons may exist to grant access to classified information to an immigrant alien or a foreign national. Such individuals may be granted a "Limited Access Authorization" (LAA) in those rare circumstances where a non-U.S. citizen - NOT REPRESENTING A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT OR OTHER ENTITY - possesses a unique or unusual skill or expertise that is urgently needed in pursuit of a specific DoD requirement involving access to specified classified information for which a cleared or clearable U.S. citizen is not available. LAAs may be granted only at the SECRET and CONFIDENTIAL level. LAAs for TOP SECRET are prohibited. Interim access is not authorized pending approval of a LAA.

1. Check to ensure that all non-U.S. citizens fitting the above described situation have had an LAA granted prior to being permitted access to sensitive duties, classified information and/or systems.  

2. Ensure that the information the non-U S. citizen has access to is approved for release to the persons country or countries of citizenship, in accordance with DoD Directive 5230.11. 

3. Ensure the non-U.S. citizen has been the subject of a favorably completed (within the last 5 years) and adjudicated SSBI prior to granting an LAA. If the SSBI cannot provide full investigative coverage, a polygraph examination (if there are no host country legal prohibitions) to resolve the remaining personnel security issues must be favorably completed before granting access.

4. Ensure that if geographical, political, or medical situations prevent the full completion of the SSBI or
prevent the polygraph examination to supplement a less than full SSBI, an LAA may be granted only with approval of the DDI(I&S).

TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT: This check is applicable where any non-U.S. citizens (not representing a foreign Government or entity) are  employed in a tactical environment with access to US Classified or Sensitive Systems.'

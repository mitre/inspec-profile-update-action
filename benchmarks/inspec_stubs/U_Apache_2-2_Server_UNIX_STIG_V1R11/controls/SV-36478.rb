That is, in addition to allowing or denying all access rights, a rule can be specified that allows or denies partial access rights.  For example, users can be given read-only access rights to files, to view the information but not change the files.

This check verifies that the htpasswd file is only accessible by system administrators or web managers, with the account running the web service having group permissions of read and execute.  htpasswd is a utility used by Netscape and Apache to provide for password access to designated web sites.

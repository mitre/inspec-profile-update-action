For Solaris 11, 11.1, 11.2, and 11.3, that use IP Filter, the IP Filter Management profile is required.

Check that the IP Filter firewall is enabled and configured so that only authorized sessions are allowed.

# svcs ipfilter

If ipfilter is not listed with a state of online, this is a finding.

The IP Filter Management profile is required.

Check that the filters are configured properly.

# ipfstat -io

If the output of this command does not include these lines:

block out log all keep state keep frags
block in log all
block in log from any to 255.255.255.255/32
block in log from any to 127.0.0.1/32

This is a finding.

Even if the lines above are included in the output, it is possible that other lines can contradict the firewall settings. Review the firewall rules and ensure that they conform to organizational and mission requirements. If the firewall rules are not configured to organizational standards, this is a finding.

For Solaris 11.3 or newer, that use Packet Filter, the Network Firewall Management rights profile is required.

Check that the Packet Filter firewall is enabled and configured so that only authorized sessions are allowed.
# svcs firewall:default

If firewall is not listed with a state of "online", this is a finding.

The Network Firewall Management rights profile is required.
Check that the filters are configured properly.
# pfctl -s rules

If the output of this command does not include this line:

block drop log (to pflog0) all

This is a finding.
Check that the Packet Filter firewall logging daemon is enabled.
svcs firewall/pflog:default
If pflog is not listed with a state of "online", this is a finding.'

For Solaris 11, 11.1, 11.2, and 11.3, that use IP Filter, configure and enable the IP Filters policy.

For Solaris 11.3 or newer, that use Packet Filter, configure and enable the Packet Filterâ€™s policy.
# pfedit /etc/firewall/pf.conf.

Enable Packet Filter logging daemon.
# svcadm enable firewall/pflog:default

Note: Because the default firewall rules block all network access to the system, ensure that there is still a method to access the system such as SSH or console access prior to activating the firewall rules. Operational requirements may dictate the addition of protocols such as SSH, DNS, NTP, HTTP, and HTTPS to be allowed.'

  desc "Protection of DBMS data, transaction and audit data files stored by the host operating system is dependent on OS controls. When different applications share the same database, resource contention and security controls are required to isolate and protect an application's data from other applications. In addition, it is an Oracle best practice to separate data, transaction logs, and audit logs into separate physical directories according to Oracleâ€™s OFA (Optimal Flexible Architecture). And finally, DBMS software libraries and configuration files also require differing access control lists."

If DBMS data, transaction log or audit data files are stored in the same directory, this is a finding.

If multiple applications are accessing the database and the database data files are stored in the same directory, this is a finding.

If multiple applications are accessing the database and database data is separated into separate physical directories according to application, this check is not a finding.'

Example directory structure:
/*/app/oracle/oradata/db_name
/*/app/oracle/admin/db_name/arch/*
/*/app/oracle/oradata/db_name/audit
/*/app/oracle/fast_recovery_area/db_name/

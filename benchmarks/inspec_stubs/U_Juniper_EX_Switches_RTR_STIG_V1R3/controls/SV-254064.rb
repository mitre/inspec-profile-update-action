The service provider must guarantee the customer that traffic from one VPN does not leak into another VPN or into the core, and that core traffic must not leak into any VPN. Hence, it is imperative that each CE-facing interface can only be associated to one VRFâ€”that alone is the fundamental framework for traffic separation.'

Note: In L3 VPN, the CE router forms an adjacency with the PE router (OSPF in the example).

If any VRFs are not bound to the appropriate physical or logical interface, this is a finding.)

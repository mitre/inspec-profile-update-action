Note: Some Juniper devices support both monolithic filters and filter lists. Filter lists separate each term, or set of terms, into a separate filter that is applied sequentially to an interface. If using filter lists, the keywords "input" or "output" change to "input-list" or "output-list". Verify the final list item is a deny-all filter. The deny-all filter is created once per family and can be reused across multiple lists. For example:

input-list [ permit_mgt permit_routing_protocols default-deny ];

If the router does not block any traffic destined to itself that is not sourced from the OOBM network or the NOC, this is a finding.

Note: If the platform does not support the receive path filter, verify that all non-OOBM interfaces have an ingress firewall filter to restrict access to that interface address or any of the routerâ€™s loopback addresses to only traffic sourced from the management network. An exception would be to allow packets destined to these interfaces used for troubleshooting, such as ping and traceroute.'

Ensure that traffic from the managed network is not able to access the OOBM gateway router using either receive path or interface firewall filters.

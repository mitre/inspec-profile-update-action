  desc 'Without the use of multifactor authentication, the ease of access to privileged functions is greatly increased.

Multifactor authentication requires using two or more factors to achieve authentication.

Factors include: 
(i) something a user knows (e.g., password/PIN); 
(ii) something a user has (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); or 
(iii) something a user is (e.g., biometric).

User access to Prisma Cloud Compute must use multifactor (x.509 based) authentication.

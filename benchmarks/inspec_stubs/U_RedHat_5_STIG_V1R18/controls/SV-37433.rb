View the password file to determine where the home directories for users are: 

# more /etc/passwd

Once the directory for the human users is determined, grep for the lists of world writable files and directories within the usersâ€™ home directories.

An example would be:
# grep /opt/app/bin/daemon /home/*/.*  

where /home is the directory for the human users on the system and /opt/app/bin/daemon is a world writable file.'

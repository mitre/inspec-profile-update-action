If aide is not installed, ask the SA what file integrity tool is being used to check the system.

Check the global crontabs for the presence of an "aide" job to run at least weekly, if aide is installed. Otherwise, check for the presence of a cron job to run the alternate file integrity checking application.

# grep aide /etc/cron*/*

If a tool is being run then the configuration file for the appropriate tool needs to be checked for  selection lines /bin, /sbin, /lib, and /usr.

Procedure:
Check the root crontab (crontab -l) and the global crontabs in /etc/crontab, /etc/cron.d/* for the presence of an "aide" job to run at least weekly, which should have asterisks (*) in columns 3, 4, and 5.

Check the weekly cron directory (/etc/cron.weekly) for any script running "aide --check" or "aide -C" or simply "aide". If there is not, this is a finding.

NOTE: The frequency may be increased to daily, if necessary, in accordance with the contingency plan.'

Time stamps generated by the application include date and time. Time is commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC.'

Note: UTC is the default; hence, the command set time-zone may not be seen in the configuration. This can be verified using the show system uptime command.

If the router is not configured record time stamps for log records that can be mapped to UTC or GMT, this is a finding.'

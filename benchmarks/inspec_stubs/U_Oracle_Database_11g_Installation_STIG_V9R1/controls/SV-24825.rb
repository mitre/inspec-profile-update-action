  desc 'DBMS audit logs are essential to the investigation and prosecution of unauthorized access to the DBMS data. Unless audit logs are available for review, the extent of data compromise may not be determined and the vulnerability exploited may not be discovered.

For each Oracle database on the host, determine the location of the database audit trail.

From SQL*Plus:

  select value from v$parameter where name = 'audit_trail';

If the audit trail is directed to database tables (DB*), ensure the audit table data is included in the database backups.

Backups of host system log files are covered in host system security reviews and are not covered here.

Other Oracle log files include:

-  Listener trace file (specified in the listener.ora file)
-  SQLNet trace file (specified in the sqlnet.ora file)
-  Oracle database alert and trace files (specified in Oracle parameters):
  -- audit_file_dest
  -- db_recovery_file_dest
  -- diagnostic_dest â€“ 11.1 and higher
  -- log_archive_dest
  -- log_archive_dest_n

If evidence of inclusion of all audit log files in regular DBMS or host backups does not exist, this is a Finding."

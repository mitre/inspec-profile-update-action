  desc 'Configuring the Voice Video Session Manager in accordance with CNSSI 5000 for unclassified communication systems supporting VVoIP endpoints within SCIFs and SAPFs ensures compliance with federal standards and establishes a common security baseline across DoD that reflects the most restrictive security posture consistent with operational requirements. 

Voice Video Session Managers may support voice video endpoints that could potentially be activated from the session manager (inadvertently or covertly) and transmit classified conversations over unclassified networks if not properly configured. Voice Video Endpoint microphones and speakers may be activated to pick up conversation audio within the area and conduct it over the network connection, even when the endpoint is on-hook. The Technical Surveillance Counter-Measures (TSCM) program protects sensitive government information, to include classified information, through the establishment of on-hook audio security standards.

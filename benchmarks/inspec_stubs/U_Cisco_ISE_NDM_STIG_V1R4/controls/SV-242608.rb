There may also be instances when specific user actions need to be performed on the network device without unique administrator identification or authentication.

A shared/group account credential is a shared form of authentication that allows multiple individuals to access the network device using a single account. 

Cisco ISE introduces a Generate Password option on the user and administrator creation page to generate instant password adhering to Cisco ISE password policies. This helps the users or administrators to use the password generated by Cisco ISE than spending time in thinking of a safe password to be configured.'

  desc 'Without coordinated reporting between separate devices, it is not possible to identify the true scale and possible target of an attack.

Integration of the ALG with a system-wide intrusion detection system supports continuous monitoring and incident response programs. This requirement applies to monitoring at internal boundaries using TLS gateways, web content filters, email gateways, and other types of ALGs.

ALGs can work as part of the network monitoring capabilities to off-load inspection functions from the external boundary IDPS by performing more granular content inspection of protocols at the upper layers of the OSI reference model.'

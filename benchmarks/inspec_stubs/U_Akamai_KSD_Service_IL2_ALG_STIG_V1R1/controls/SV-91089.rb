Changing conditions include changes in the threat environment and detection of potentially harmful or adverse events.

Changes to the ALG must take effect when made by an authorized administrator and the new configuration is put in place or committed, including upon restart of the application or reboot of the system. With some devices, the changes take effect as the configuration is changed, while with others, the new configuration must be submitted to the device. In any case, the behavior of the ALG must immediately be affected to reflect the configuration change.'

  title 'Kona Site Defender must off-load audit records onto a centralized log server in real time.'
  desc 'Off-loading ensures audit information does not get overwritten if the limited audit storage capacity is reached and also protects the audit record in case the system/component being audited is compromised.

Off-loading is a common process in information systems with limited audit storage capacity. The audit storage on the ALG is used only in a transitory fashion until the system can communicate with the centralized log server designated for storing the audit records, at which point the information is transferred. However, DoD requires that the log be transferred in real time, which indicates that the time from event detection to off-loading is seconds or less.

This does not apply to audit logs generated on behalf of the device itself (management).'

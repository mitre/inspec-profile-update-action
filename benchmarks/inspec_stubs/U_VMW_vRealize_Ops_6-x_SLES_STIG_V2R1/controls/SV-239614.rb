  title 'The SLES for vRealize must implement non-executable data to protect its memory from unauthorized code execution.'
  desc 'Some adversaries launch attacks with the intent of executing code in non-executable regions of memory or in memory locations that are prohibited. Security safeguards employed to protect memory include, for example, data execution prevention and address space layout randomization. Data execution prevention safeguards can either be hardware-enforced or software-enforced with hardware providing the greater strength of mechanism.

Examples of attacks are buffer overflow attacks.'
  desc 'check', 'The stock kernel has support for non-executable program stacks compiled in by default. Verify that the option was specified when the kernel was built:

# grep -i "execute" /var/log/boot.msg

The message: "NX (Execute Disable) protection: active" will be written in the boot log when compiled in the kernel. This is the default for x86_64.

To activate this support, the "noexec=on" kernel parameter must be specified at boot time. Check for a message with the following command:

# grep â€“i "noexec" /var/log/boot.msg

The message: "Kernel command line: <boot parameters> noexec=on" will be written to the boot log when properly appended to the "/boot/grub/menu.lst" file.

If non-executable program stacks have not been configured, this is a finding.'
  desc 'fix', 'Edit the "/boot/grub/menu.lst" file and add "noexec=on" to the end of each kernel line entry. A system restart is required to implement this change.'

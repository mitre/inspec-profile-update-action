- Disable macros by default Â¬- all macros are disabled in the programmatically opened application. 
- Macros enabled (default) - macros can run in the programmatically opened application. This option enforces the default configuration in Excel, PowerPoint, and Word. 
- User application macro security level - macro functionality is determined by the setting in the "Macro Settings" section of the Trust Center.

In an SQL environment, types of access include, but are not necessarily limited to:
SELECT
INSERT
UPDATE
DELETE
EXECUTE

To aid in diagnosis, it is necessary to keep track of failed attempts in addition to the successful ones.'

To determine if an audit is configured, execute the following script. 
Run this TSQL command to determine if SQL Auditing AuditActionGroups are configured:
  SELECT DISTINCT sd.audit_action_name 
  FROM sys.database_audit_specification_details sd
  JOIN sys.database_audit_specifications s 
  ON s.database_specification_id = sd.database_specification_id
  WHERE (name = 'SqlDbAuditing_ServerAuditSpec' /*Server Audit*/
      OR name = 'SqlDbAuditing_AuditSpec') /*Database Audit*/
  AND s.is_state_enabled = 1
  ORDER BY sd.audit_action_name

If no values exist for AuditActionGroup, this is a finding. 

Verify the following AuditActionGroup(s) are configured:
SCHEMA_OBJECT_ACCESS_GROUP

If any listed AuditActionGroups do not exist in the configuration, this is a finding."

  title 'All wireless PDA clients used for remote access to a DoD network must have a VPN capability that supports CAC authentication.'
  desc 'If an adversary can bypass a VPNâ€™s authentication controls, then the adversary can compromise DoD data transmitted over the VPN and conduct further attacks on DoD networks.  CAC authentication greatly mitigates this risk by providing strong two-factor authentication.'
  desc 'check', 'Interview the IAO and/or site wireless device administrator and inspect a sample (3-4) of site devices.

Verify the VPN client supports CAC authentication to the DoD network (recommend asking the site wireless device administrator to demo this capability).

Mark as a finding if CAC authentication is not supported.'

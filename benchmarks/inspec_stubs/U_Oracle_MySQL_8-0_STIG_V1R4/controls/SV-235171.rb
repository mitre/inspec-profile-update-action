  desc 'The content captured in audit records must be managed from a central location (necessitating automation). Centralized management of audit records and logs provides for efficiency in maintenance and management of records, as well as the backup and archiving of those records. 

The MySQL Server writes audit records to files in the file system and this data is available via ReadOnly using functions within the MySQL Server. These files are available via SQL functions or on the filesystem in JSON and XML formats providing compatibility for off-loading audit records to centralized system(s).'

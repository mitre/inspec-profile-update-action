  desc 'Without the ability to centrally manage the content captured in the audit records, identification, troubleshooting, and correlation of suspicious behavior would be difficult and could lead to a delayed or incomplete analysis of an ongoing attack.

This requirement requires that the content captured in audit records be managed from a central location (necessitating automation). Centralized management of audit records and logs provides for efficiency in maintenance and management of records, as well as the backup and archiving of those records. Application components requiring centralized audit log management must have the capability to support centralized management.

This requirement applies to centralized management applications or similar types of applications designed to manage and configure audit record capture.'
  desc 'check', 'Review the application documentation and interview the application administrator to determine the logging architecture of the application.

If the application is configured to log application event entries to a centralized, enterprise based logging solution that meets this requirement, the requirement is not applicable.

Review the application components and the log management capabilities of the application.

Verify the application log management interface includes the ability to centrally manage the configuration of what is captured in the logs of all application components. 

If the application does not provide the ability to centrally manage the content captured in the audit logs, this is a finding.'

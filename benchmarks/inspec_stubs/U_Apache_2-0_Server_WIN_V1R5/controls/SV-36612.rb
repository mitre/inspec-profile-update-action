While having server configuration and status information available as a web page may be convenient, itâ€™s recommended that these modules NOT be enabled: Once mod_info is loaded into the server, its handler capability is available in per-directory .htaccess files and can leak sensitive information from the configuration directives of other Apache modules such as system paths, usernames/passwords, database names, etc. If mod_status is loaded into the server, its handler capability is available in all configuration files, including per-directory files (e.g., .htaccess) and may have security-related ramifications.'

Failure to properly control access to product resources could result in the compromise of the operating system environment, and compromise the confidentiality of customer data.  Many utilities assign resource controls that can be granted to system programmers only in greater than read authority.  Resources are also granted to certain non systems personnel with read only authority.'

Ensure that all IBM System Display and Search Facility (SDSF) resources are properly protected according to the requirements specified in the Site Security Plan (SSP). The plan should be based on the SDSF SAF Resources table in the z/OS STIG Addendum and validated by the site ISSO. If this and the following guidance is true, this is not a finding.

___       The RACF resources and/or generic equivalent as designated in the above table are defined with a default access of NONE.

___       The RACF resource access authorizations restrict access to the appropriate personnel as designated in the above table.

___       The RACF resource logging is specified as designated in the above table.

___ The RACF resource access authorizations are defined with UACC(NONE) and NOWARNING.

___       The RACF resource access authorizations for SDSF GROUP.group-name will require additional analysis to justify access.'

The actual resource class, resources, and/or prefixes are determined when the product is actually installed on a system through the productâ€™s installation guide and can be site-specific.)

Ensure that all IBM System Display and Search Facility (SDSF) resources are properly protected according to the requirements specified in the Site Security Plan (SSP). The plan should be based on the SDSF SAF Resources table in the z/OS STIG Addendum and validated by the site ISSO. 

Use SDSF SAF Resources and SDSF SAF Resource Descriptions tables in the zOS STIG Addendum/SSP. These tables list the resources and access requirements for IBM System Display and Search Facility (SDSF); ensure the following guidelines are followed:

The RACF resources and/or generic equivalent as designated in the above table are defined with a default access of NONE.

The RACF resource access authorizations restrict access to the appropriate personnel as designated in the above table.

The RACF resource logging is specified as designated in the above table.

The RACF resource access authorizations for the resources designated in the above table specify UACC(NONE) and NOWARNING.

The RACF resource access authorizations for SDSF GROUP.group-name will require additional analysis to justify access.

The following commands are provided as a sample for implementing resource controls:

RDEFINE SDSF ISFATTR.JOBCL.** UACC(NONE) OWNER(ADMIN) AUDIT(FAILURE(READ))
PERMIT ISFATTR.JOBCL.** CLASS(SDSF) ACCESS(UPDATE) ID(operaudt)
PERMIT ISFATTR.JOBCL.** CLASS(SDSF) ACCESS(UPDATE) ID(syspaudt)'

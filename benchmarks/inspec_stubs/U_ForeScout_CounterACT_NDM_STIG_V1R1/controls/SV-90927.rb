Verify by connecting to the appliance via SSH using standard user/operator privilege.

1. After logon, type the following command at the prompt using the IP address of the configured NTP server:
fstool ntp test <ip address>
2. Verify the date references accurate time and the time zone points to UTC next to the year.

If CounterACT does not record time stamps for audit records that can be mapped to UTC, this is a finding.'

To ensure logging is enabled, review supplementary content APPENDIX-C for instructions on enabling logging.

Using pgaudit, PostgreSQL can be configured to audit these requests. See supplementary content APPENDIX-B for documentation on installing pgaudit.

With pgaudit installed, the following configurations should be made:

$ sudo su - postgres
$ vi ${PGDATA?}/postgresql.conf

Add the following parameters (or edit existing parameters):

pgaudit.log='ddl, role, read, write'
log_connections='on'
log_disconnections='on'

Now, as the system administrator, reload the server with the new configuration:

$ sudo systemctl reload postgresql-${PGVER?}"

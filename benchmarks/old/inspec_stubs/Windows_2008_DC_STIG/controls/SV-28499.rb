  title 'The Kerberos user ticket lifetime must be limited to 10 hours or less.'
  desc 'In Kerberos, there are 2 types of tickets: Ticket Granting Tickets (TGTs) and Service Tickets.  Kerberos tickets have a limited lifetime so the time an attacker has to implement an attack is limited.  This policy controls how long TGTs can be renewed.  With Kerberos, the userâ€™s initial authentication to the domain controller results in a TGT which is then used to request Service Tickets to resources.  Upon startup, each computer gets a TGT before requesting a service ticket to the domain controller and any other computers it needs to access.  For services that startup under a specified user account, users must always get a TGT first, then get Service Tickets to all computers and services accessed.'

If the value for "Maximum lifetime for user ticket" is "0" or greater than "10" hours, this is a finding.'

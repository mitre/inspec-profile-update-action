Determine the classification level of the Windows domain controller.

If the classification level of the Windows domain controller is higher than the level of the networks, review the site network diagram(s) and directory implementation documentation to determine if NSA-approved encryption is used to protect the replication network traffic.

If the classification level of the Windows domain controller is higher than the level of the network traversed and NSA-approved encryption is not used, this is a finding.'

Key size: 2048 bits or more (PEM encoded)
CRT format (Base-64)
x509 version 3
SubjectAltName must contain DNS Name=<machine_FQDN>
Contains the following Key Usages: Digital Signature, Non Repudiation, Key Encipherment

Verify that the issued certificate includes the full issuing chain. If it does not, concatenate the Base-64 intermediates and root onto the issued machine ssl cert.

Export the entire certificate issuing chain up to the root in Base-64 format, concatenate the individual certs into one file that will be used in the next steps when prompted for the signing certificate.

Run the certificate-manager tool:

Appliance:
/usr/lib/vmware-vmca/bin/certificate-manager

Windows:
C:\\Program Files\\VMware\\vCenter Server\\vmcad\\certificate-manager.bat

Select option "1" to replace the machine ssl certificate. Select option "2" to specify existing certificate and private key. Supply the information as prompted remembering the signing certificate file built up previously.'

Passwords may also be a source of entropy for generation of key encryption or data encryption keys. If a password is not required to access data, then this data is accessible to any adversary who obtains physical possession of the device. Requiring that a password be successfully entered before the mobile device data is unencrypted mitigates this risk.

Note: MDF PP v.2.0 requires a Password Authentication Factor and requires management of its length and complexity. It leaves open whether the existence of a password is subject to management. This STIGID addresses the configuration to require a password, which is critical to the cybersecurity posture of the device.

The ability to crack a password is a function of how many attempts an adversary is permitted, how quickly an adversary can do each attempt, and the size of the password space. The longer the minimum length of the password is, the larger the password space. Having a too-short minimum password length significantly reduces password strength, increasing the chance of password compromise and resulting device and data compromise.

2. Expand the “IT policies” tab on the left pane.
3. Select and open each IT policy assigned to users in turn.
4. After opening the policy, select the “Settings” and “BlackBerry” tabs.
5. Scroll down to the “Device functionality” group of IT policy rules.
6. Verify "Allow wireless software updates" is set to "allow".
7. Verify a Device SR requirement profile is assigned to every user:
-Click on "Users and Devices" tab at the top of the screen.
-Select at least 5 random users in-turn
-Select the user
-Verify a Device SR requirement profile is listed under IT policy and profile
Note: Step 7 above will, by default, verify "Maximum software release version" has a value.

If the BES IT policy rule "Allow wireless software updates" is not selected and a Device SR requirement profile has not been assigned to all users, this is a finding.

The ability to crack a password is a function of how many attempts an adversary is permitted, how quickly an adversary can do each attempt, and the size of the password space. The longer the minimum length of the password is, the larger the password space. Having a too-short minimum password length significantly reduces password strength, increasing the chance of password compromise and resulting device and data compromise. A password is required for the Personal Space to stop access to the BlackBerry desktop by an unauthorized person. This is a mobile security best practice control.

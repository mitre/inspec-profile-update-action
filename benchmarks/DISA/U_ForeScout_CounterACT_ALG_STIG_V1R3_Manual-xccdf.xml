System use notifications are required only for access via logon interfaces with human users and are not required when such human interfaces do not exist, for example, with CounterACT guest access function. This requirement applies to network elements that have the concept of a user account and have the logon function residing on the network element. This requirement is not for access to the device itself, such as with system administrators of CounterACT, but rather is related to the network access control function provided to the users.

The banner must be formatted in accordance with DTM-08-060. Use the following verbiage for network elements that can accommodate banners of 1300 characters:

Audit processing failures include: software/hardware errors, failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded. Responses to audit failure depend upon the nature of the failure mode.

When availability is an overriding concern, other approved actions in response to an audit failure are as follows: 

1. If the failure was caused by the lack of audit record storage capacity, the network element must continue generating audit records if possible (automatically restarting the audit service if necessary), overwriting the oldest audit records in a first-in-first-out manner.

2. If audit records are sent to a centralized collection server and communication with this server is lost or the server fails, the network element must queue audit records locally until communication is restored or until the audit records are retrieved manually. Upon restoration of the connection to the centralized collection server, action should be taken to synchronize the local audit data with the collection server.

A NAC is an essential security service and should not be shut down in the event of an audit failure.

If CounterACT implementation does not include an Enterprise Manager combined with Appliances or a high availability solution to ensure redundancy, this is a finding.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-265638"><title>SRG-NET-000366</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-265638r1001001_rule" weight="10.0" severity="high"><version>CACT-AG-999999</version><title>The version of ForeScout CounterAct must be a supported version.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Security flaws with software applications are discovered daily. Vendors are constantly updating and patching their products to address newly discovered security vulnerabilities. Organizations (including any contractor to the organization) are required to promptly install security-relevant software updates (e.g., patches, service packs, and hot fixes). Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system error handling must also be addressed expeditiously.

Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software may vary based on a variety of factors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw).

This requirement will apply to software patch management solutions that are used to install patches across the enclave and to applications themselves that are not part of that patch management solution. For example, many browsers today provide the capability to install their own patch software. Patch criticality, as well as system criticality will vary. Therefore, the tactical situations regarding the patch management process will also vary. This means that the period used must be a configurable parameter. Time frames for application of security-relevant software updates may be dependent upon the Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process.

The application will be configured to check for and install security-relevant software updates within an identified period from the availability of the update. The specific period will be defined by an authoritative source (e.g., IAVM, CTOs, DTMs, and STIGs).&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target ForeScout CounterACT ALG</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>ForeScout CounterACT ALG</dc:subject><dc:identifier>5297</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-002409</ident><fixtext fixref="F-53958r798705_fix">Upgrade to a supported version.</fixtext><fix id="F-53958r798705_fix" /><check system="C-69553r997798_chk"><check-content-ref href="ForeScout_CounterACT_ALG_STIG.xml" name="M" /><check-content>ForeScout CounterAct versions supported by this STIG (Version 8 and earlier) are no longer supported by the vendor.

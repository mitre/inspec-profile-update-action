Blocking or restricting detected harmful or suspicious communications between interconnected networks enforces approved authorizations for controlling the flow of traffic.

The firewall that filters traffic outbound to interconnected networks with different security policies must be configured with filters (i.e., rules, access control lists [ACLs], screens, and policies) that permit, restrict, or block traffic based on organization-defined traffic authorizations. Filtering must include packet header and packet attribute information, such as IP addresses and port numbers.

Configure filters to perform certain actions when packets match specified attributes, including the following actions:

- Apply a policy
- Accept, reject, or discard the packets
- Classify the packets based on their source address
- Evaluate the next term in the filter
- Increment a packet counter
- Set the packets’ loss priority
- Specify an IPsec SA (if IPsec is used in the implementation)
- Specify the forwarding path
- Write an alert or message to the system log.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Fortinet FortiGate Firewall</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Fortinet FortiGate Firewall</dc:subject><dc:identifier>5258</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-001414</ident><fixtext fixref="F-37283r611398_fix">The fix can be performed on FortiGate GUI or CLI.

Remote access is access to DoD non-public information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network.

Automated monitoring of remote access sessions allows organizations to detect cyberattacks and ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies by auditing connection activities of remote access capabilities from a variety of information system components (e.g., servers, workstations, notebook computers, smart phones, and tablets).&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Fortinet FortiGate Firewall</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Fortinet FortiGate Firewall</dc:subject><dc:identifier>5258</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-000067</ident><fixtext fixref="F-37284r611401_fix">This fix can be performed on the FortiGate GUI or on the CLI.

Some of these functions and services are installed and enabled by default. The organization must determine which functions and services are required to perform the content filtering and other necessary core functionality for each component of the firewall. These unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may remain unsecured. They increase the risk to the platform by providing additional attack vectors.

Some services may be security related, but based on the firewall’s role in the architecture, must not be installed on the same hardware. For example, the device may serve as a router, VPN, or other perimeter services. However, if these functions are not part of the documented role of the firewall in the enterprise or branch architecture, the software and licenses must not be installed on the device. This mitigates the risk of exploitation of unconfigured services or services that are not kept updated with security fixes. If left unsecured, these services may provide a threat vector.

Some services are not authorized for combination with the firewall and individual policy must be in place to instruct the administrator to remove these services. Examples of these services are Network Time Protocol (NTP), domain name server (DNS), email server, FTP server, web server, and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).

Directions for the attack are obtainable on the internet and in hacker groups. Without filtering enabled for these attacks, the firewall will allow these attacks beyond the protected boundary.

Configure the perimeter and internal boundary firewall to guard against the three general methods of well-known DoS attacks: flooding attacks, protocol sweeping attacks, and unauthorized port scanning.

Flood attacks occur when the host receives too much traffic to buffer and slows down or crashes. Popular flood attacks include ICMP flood and SYN flood. A TCP flood attack of SYN packets initiating connection requests can overwhelm the device until it can no longer process legitimate connection requests, resulting in DoS. An ICMP flood can overload the device with so many echo requests (ping requests) that it expends all its resources responding and can no longer process valid network traffic, also resulting in DoS. An attacker might use session table floods and SYN-ACK-ACK proxy floods to fill up the session table of a host.

In an IP address sweep attack, an attacker sends ICMP echo requests (pings) to multiple destination addresses. If a target host replies, the reply reveals the target’s IP address to the attacker. In a TCP sweep attack, an attacker sends TCP SYN packets to the target device as part of the TCP handshake. If the device responds to those packets, the attacker gets an indication that a port in the target device is open, which makes the port vulnerable to attack. In a UDP sweep attack, an attacker sends UDP packets to the target device. If the device responds to those packets, the attacker gets an indication that a port in the target device is open, which makes the port vulnerable to attack.

In a port scanning attack, an unauthorized application is used to scan the host devices for available services and open ports for subsequent use in an attack. This type of scanning can be used as a DoS attack when the probing packets are sent excessively.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Fortinet FortiGate Firewall</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Fortinet FortiGate Firewall</dc:subject><dc:identifier>5258</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-002385</ident><fixtext fixref="F-37301r611452_fix">Log in to the FortiGate GUI with Super-Admin privilege.

The firewall generates an alert that notifies designated personnel of the Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), which require real-time alerts. These messages should include a severity-level indicator or code as an indicator of the criticality of the incident. These indicators reflect the occurrence of a compromise or a potential compromise.

Since these incidents require immediate action, these messages are assigned a critical or level 1 priority/severity, depending on the system's priority schema.

CJCSM 6510.01B, "Cyber Incident Handling Program", lists nine Cyber Incident and Reportable Event Categories. DoD has determined that categories identified by CJCSM 6510.01B Major Indicators (category 1, 2, 4, or 7 detection events) will require an alert when an event is detected.

Alerts may be transmitted, for example, telephonically, by electronic mail messages, or by text messaging. The firewall must either send the alert to a management console that is actively monitored by authorized personnel or use a messaging capability to send the alert directly to designated personnel.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Fortinet FortiGate Firewall</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Fortinet FortiGate Firewall</dc:subject><dc:identifier>5258</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-002664</ident><fixtext fixref="F-37308r611473_fix">Syslog server is used to send alerts for DoS incidents.

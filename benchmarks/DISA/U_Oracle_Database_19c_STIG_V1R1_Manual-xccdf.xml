Unlimited concurrent connections to the DBMS could allow a successful denial-of-service (DoS) attack by exhausting connection resources; and a system can also fail or be degraded by an overload of legitimate users. Limiting the number of concurrent sessions per user is helpful in reducing these risks.

This requirement addresses concurrent session control for a single account. It does not address concurrent sessions by a single user via multiple system accounts; and it does not deal with the total number of sessions across all accounts.

The capability to limit the number of concurrent sessions per user must be configured in or added to the DBMS (for example, by use of a logon trigger), when this is technically feasible. Note that it is not sufficient to limit sessions via a web server or application server alone, because legitimate users and adversaries can potentially connect to the DBMS by other means.

The organization will need to define the maximum number of concurrent sessions by account type, by account, or a combination thereof. In deciding on the appropriate number, it is important to consider the work requirements of the various types of users. For example, two might be an acceptable limit for general users accessing the database via an application; but 10 might be too few for a database administrator using a database management GUI tool, where each query tab and navigation pane may count as a separate session.

(Sessions may also be referred to as connections or logons, which for the purposes of this requirement are synonyms.)&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Oracle Database 19c</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Oracle Database 19c</dc:subject><dc:identifier>5672</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-000054</ident><fixtext fixref="F-74429r1064762_fix">Limit concurrent connections for each system account to a number less than or equal to the organization-defined number of sessions using the following SQL. Create profiles that conform to the requirements. Assign users to the appropriate profile.

The user profile, ORA_STIG_PROFILE, has been provided with Oracle 19c to satisfy the STIG requirements pertaining to the profile parameters. Oracle recommends that this profile be customized with any site-specific requirements and assigned to all users where applicable.

The recommended value for the SESSIONS_PER_USER setting in Oracle 19c is 10 or less. Limiting the number of concurrent sessions can help prevent: Memory resource exhaustion from poorly formed requests, denial-of-service attacks, and one user from tying up all resources.

Change the value of SESSIONS_PER_USER (along with the other parameters, where relevant) from UNLIMITED to DOD-compliant, site-specific requirements for the ORA_STIG_PROFILE and then assign users to the ORA_STIG_PROFILE profile.

Example: 
ALTER PROFILE ORA_STIG_PROFILE LIMIT SESSIONS_PER_USER 10;

To assign the user to the profile do the following:
ALTER USER &lt;username&gt; PROFILE ORA_STIG_PROFILE;</fixtext><fix id="F-74429r1064762_fix" /><check system="C-74528r1064761_chk"><check-content-ref href="U_Oracle_Database_19c_V1R0-1_Manual-xccdf.xml" name="M" /><check-content>Retrieve the settings for concurrent sessions for each profile with the query:
SELECT * FROM SYS.DBA_PROFILES WHERE RESOURCE_NAME = 'SESSIONS_PER_USER';

If the DBMS settings for concurrent sessions for each profile are greater than the site-specific maximum number of sessions, this is a finding.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-270496"><title>SRG-APP-000001-DB-000031</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-270496r1064766_rule" weight="10.0" severity="medium"><version>O19C-00-000200</version><title>Oracle Database must protect against or limit the effects of organization-defined types of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;A variety of technologies exist to limit, or in some cases, eliminate the effects of DoS attacks. For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain types of packets to protect devices on an organization's internal network from being directly affected by DoS attacks.

Employing increased capacity and bandwidth combined with service redundancy may reduce the susceptibility to some DoS attacks.

A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational information system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user access) without terminating network sessions. 

Session termination ends all processes associated with a user's logical session except those batch processes/jobs that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated. 

Conditions or trigger events requiring automatic session termination can include, for example, organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, and time-of-day restrictions on information system use.

Security labels are abstractions representing the basic properties or characteristics of an entity (e.g., subjects and objects) with respect to safeguarding information. 

These labels are typically associated with internal data structures (e.g., tables, rows) within the database and are used to enable the implementation of access control and flow control policies, reflect special dissemination, handling, or distribution instructions, or support other aspects of the information security policy. 

One example includes marking data as classified or CUI. These security labels may be assigned manually or during data processing, but, either way, it is imperative these assignments are maintained while the data is in storage. If the security labels are lost when the data is stored, there is the risk of a data compromise.

Some DBMS systems provide the feature to assign security labels to data elements. If labeling is required, implementation options include the Oracle Label Security package, or a third-party product, or custom-developed functionality.

A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential oversight or other error. Managing accounts for the same person in multiple places is inefficient and prone to problems with consistency and synchronization.

A comprehensive application account management process that includes automation helps to ensure that accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed. 

Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to act on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended, or terminated, or by disabling accounts located in noncentralized account stores, such as multiple servers. Account management functions can also include assignment of group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging to notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephone notification to report atypical system account usage.

Oracle Database must be configured to automatically use organization-level account management functions, and these functions must immediately enforce the organization's current account policy.

To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DOD-approved PKIs, all DOD systems, including databases, must be properly configured to implement access control policies. 

Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. 

Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system.

This requirement is applicable to access control enforcement applications, a category that includes database management systems. If the DBMS does not follow applicable policy when approving access, it may be in conflict with networks or other applications in the information system. This may result in users either gaining or being denied access inappropriately and in conflict with applicable policy.

Examples of particular actions taken by individuals include creating information, sending a message, approving information (e.g., indicating concurrence or signing a contract), and receiving a message.

Nonrepudiation protects individuals against later claims by an author of not having authored a particular document, a sender of not having transmitted a message, a receiver of not having received a message, or a signatory of not having signed a document. 

Authentication via shared accounts does not provide individual accountability for actions taken on the database management system (DBMS) or data. Whenever a single database account is used to connect to the database, a secondary authentication method that provides individual accountability is required. This scenario most frequently occurs when an externally hosted application authenticates individual users to the application and the application uses a single account to retrieve or update database information on behalf of the individual users.

When shared accounts are used without another means of identifying individual users, users may deny having performed a particular action.

This calls for inspection of application source code, which requires collaboration with the application developers. In many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored. At a minimum, the database administrator (DBA) must attempt to obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue has been addressed and must document what has been discovered.

The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is capable of generating audit records (i.e., auditable events, timestamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked).

Organizations may define the organizational personnel accountable for determining which application components must provide auditable events.

Auditing provides accountability for changes made to the database management system (DBMS) configuration or its objects and data. It provides a means to discover suspicious activity and unauthorized changes. Without auditing, a compromise may go undetected and without a means to determine accountability.

The Department of Defense has established the following as the minimum set of auditable events:
- When privileges/permissions are retrieved, added, modified or deleted.
- When unsuccessful attempts to retrieve, add, modify, delete privileges/permissions occur.
- Enforcement of access restrictions associated with changes to the configuration of the database(s).
- When security objects are accessed, modified, or deleted.
- When unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete security objects occur.
- When categories of information (e.g., classification levels/security levels) are accessed, created, modified, or deleted.
- When unsuccessful attempts to access, create, modify, or delete categorized information occur.
- All privileged activities or other system-level access.
- When unsuccessful attempts to execute privileged activities or other system-level access occurs.
- When successful or unsuccessful access to any other objects occur as specifically defined by the site.

The predefined policy ORA_SECURECONFIG is enabled by default in mixed mode.

Configure the DBMS's auditing settings to include auditing of events on the DOD-selected list of auditable events.

1. Successful attempts to access, modify, or delete privileges, security objects, security levels, or categories of information (e.g., classification levels).

To audit granting and revocation of any privilege:
create audit policy policy1 actions grant;
create audit policy policy2 actions revoke;

To audit grants of object privileges on a specific object:
create audit policy policy3 actions grant on &lt;schema&gt;.&lt;object&gt;;

If Oracle Label Security is enabled, this will audit all OLS administrative actions:
create audit policy policy4 actions component = OLS all;

2. Successful and unsuccessful logon attempts, privileged activities or other system-level access.

To audit all user logon attempts:
create audit policy policy5 actions logon;

To audit only logon attempts using administrative privileges (e.g. AS SYSDBA):
audit policy policy5 by SYS, SYSOPER, SYSBACKUP, SYSDG, SYSKM;

3. Starting and ending time for user access to the system, concurrent logons from different workstations.

This policy will audit all logon and logoff events. An individual session is identified in the UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL by the tuple (DBID, INSTANCE_ID, SESSIONID) and the start and end time will be indicated by the EVENT_TIMESTAMP of the logon and logoff events:
create audit policy policy6 actions logon, logoff;

4. Successful and unsuccessful accesses to objects.

To audit all accesses to a specific table:
create audit policy policy7 actions select, insert, delete, alter on &lt;schema&gt;.&lt;object&gt;; 

Different actions are defined for other object types. To audit all supported actions on a specific object:
create audit policy policy8 actions all on &lt;schema&gt;.&lt;object&gt;;

5. All program initiations.

To audit execution of any PL/SQL program unit:
create audit policy policy9 actions EXECUTE;

To audit execution of a specific function, procedure, or package:
create audit policy policy10 actions EXECUTE on &lt;schema&gt;.&lt;object&gt;;

6. All direct access to the information system.

[Not applicable to Database audit. Monitor using OS auditing.]

7. All account creations, modifications, disabling, and terminations.

To audit all user administration actions:
create audit policy policy11 actions create user, alter user, drop user, change password;

8. All kernel module loads, unloads, and restarts.

[Not applicable to Database audit. Monitor using OS auditing.]

9. All database parameter changes.

To audit any database parameter changes, dynamic or static:
create audit policy policy12 actions alter database, alter system, create spfile;

Applying the Policy

The following command will enable the policy in all database sessions and audit both successful and unsuccessful actions:
audit policy policy1;

To audit only unsuccessful actions, add the WHENEVER NOT SUCCESSFUL modifier:
audit policy policy1 whenever not successful;

Either command above can be limited to only database sessions started by a specific user as follows:
audit policy policy1 by &lt;user&gt;;

If Oracle returns a value something other than "TRUE", this is a finding.

Unified Audit supports named audit policies, which are defined using the CREATE AUDIT POLICY statement. A policy specifies the actions that should be audited and the objects to which it should apply. If no specific objects are included in the policy definition, it applies to all objects.

A named policy is enabled using the AUDIT POLICY statement. It can be enabled for all users, for specific users only, or for all except a specified list of users. The policy can audit successful actions, unsuccessful actions, or both.

Verifying existing audit policy: existing Unified Audit policies are listed in the view AUDIT_UNIFIED_POLICIES. The AUDIT_OPTION column contains one of the actions specified in a CREATE AUDIT POLICY statement. The AUDIT_OPTION_TYPE column contains "STANDARD ACTION" for a policy that applies to all objects or "OBJECT ACTION" for a policy that audits actions on a specific object.

select POLICY_NAME from SYS.AUDIT_UNIFIED_POLICIES where AUDIT_OPTION='GRANT' and AUDIT_OPTION_TYPE='STANDARD ACTION';

To find policies that audit privilege grants on specific objects:

select POLICY_NAME,OBJECT_SCHEMA,OBJECT_NAME from SYS.AUDIT_UNIFIED_POLICIES where AUDIT_OPTION='GRANT' and AUDIT_OPTION_TYPE='OBJECT ACTION';

The view AUDIT_UNIFIED_ENABLED_POLICIES shows which Unified Audit policies are enabled. The ENABLED_OPT and USER_NAME columns show the users for whom the policy is enabled or "ALL USERS". The SUCCESS and FAILURE columns indicate if the policy is enabled for successful or unsuccessful actions, respectively.

Although another requirement (SRG-APP-000515-DB-000318) mandates audit data be off-loaded to a centralized log management system, it remains necessary to provide space on the database server to serve as a buffer against outages and capacity limits of the off-loading mechanism.

The task of allocating audit record storage capacity is usually performed during initial installation of the database management system (DBMS) and is closely associated with the database administrator (DBA) and system administrator roles. The DBA or system administrator will usually coordinate the allocation of physical drive space with the application owner/installer and the application will prompt the installer to provide the capacity information, the physical location of the disk, or both.

In determining the capacity requirements, consider such factors as: total number of users; expected number of concurrent users during busy periods; number and type of events being monitored; types and amounts of data being captured; the frequency/speed with which audit records are off-loaded to the central log management system; and any limitations that exist on the DBMS's ability to reuse the space formerly occupied by off-loaded records.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Oracle Database 19c</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Oracle Database 19c</dc:subject><dc:identifier>5672</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-001849</ident><fixtext fixref="F-74440r1064795_fix">Allocate sufficient audit file/table space to support peak demand.

Consider deploying the Oracle Audit Vault, which is Oracle's centralized audit log management system. Oracle Audit Vault is a powerful enterprise-wide audit solution that provides centralized location and configuration of audit information that is captured in audit records which are generated by all databases including Oracle, or other databases (SQL Server, MySQL, etc.), and various components of the DBMS, as well as, operating systems, file systems, directory services, or custom audit data in either database tables or XML files.

Oracle Audit Vault consumes audit data from databases, which may be automatically purged from the target database after it has been moved to the Oracle Audit Vault Server, freeing up valuable space for business data. Oracle Audit Vault Server supports data retention policies on a per source basis, making it possible to meet internal or external compliance requirements. To prevent unauthorized access or tampering, Oracle Audit Vault encrypts audit and event data at every stage, in transmission and at rest. For Oracle Databases, Oracle Audit Vault can track changes to data, user entitlements, and stored procedures. Historical tracking of important data attributes allows users to quickly report on the lifecycle of a data attribute. User entitlements tracking enables easy reporting on which users have what privileges, along with differential reporting on what has changed since the last report. Maliciously modified stored procedures are a frequent vector for data theft-stored procedure tracking helps users quickly spot changes. With support for Oracle's unified audit, it is easy to implement best practices for auditing using preseeded audit policies.</fixtext><fix id="F-74441r1065200_fix" /><check system="C-74540r1064797_chk"><check-content-ref href="U_Oracle_Database_19c_V1R0-1_Manual-xccdf.xml" name="M" /><check-content>Review the system documentation for a description of how audit records are off-loaded.

In addition, access to audit records provides information an attacker could potentially use to his or her advantage.

To ensure the veracity of audit data, the information system and/or the application must protect audit information from any and all unauthorized access. This includes read, write, copy, etc.

This requirement can be achieved through multiple methods which will depend upon system architecture and design. Some commonly employed methods include ensuring log files enjoy the proper file system permissions using file system protections and limiting log data location.

Additionally, applications with user interfaces to audit records must not allow for the unfettered manipulation of or access to those records via the application. If the application provides access to the audit data, the application becomes accountable for ensuring that audit information is protected from unauthorized access.

Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity.

Modification or deletion of database audit data could mask the theft of, or the unauthorized modification of, sensitive data stored in the database.

Use the REVOKE statement to remove permissions from a specific user or from all users to perform actions on database objects.

REVOKE privilege-type ON [ TABLE ] { table-Name | view-Name } FROM grantees

Use the ALL PRIVILEGES privilege type to revoke all of the permissions from the user for the specified table. Can also revoke one or more table privileges by specifying a privilege-list.

Use the DELETE privilege type to revoke permission to delete rows from the specified table.

Use the INSERT privilege type to revoke permission to insert rows into the specified table.

Use the REFERENCES privilege type to revoke permission to create a foreign key reference to the specified table. If a column list is specified with the REFERENCES privilege, the permission is revoked on only the foreign key reference to the specified columns.

Use the SELECT privilege type to revoke permission to perform SELECT statements on a table or view. If a column list is specified with the SELECT privilege, the permission is revoked on only those columns. If no column list is specified, then the privilege is valid on all of the columns in the table.

Use the TRIGGER privilege type to revoke permission to create a trigger on the specified table.

Use the UPDATE privilege type to revoke permission to use the UPDATE statement on the specified table. If a column list is specified, the permission is revoked only on the specified columns.

select value from v$parameter where name = 'audit_trail';
select value from v$parameter where name = 'audit_file_dest';

If audit_trail is set to OS, XML or XML EXTENDED, this means logs are stored at the operating system level.

If audit_trail is set to OS, but the audit records are routed directly to a separate log server without writing to the local file system, this is not a finding.

If audit_trail is set to DB or "DB, EXTENDED" this means logs are stored in the database.

If any logs are written to the database, DBA_TAB_PRIVS describes all object grants in the database.

Accordingly, only qualified and authorized individuals must be allowed access to information system components for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.

Database administrator (DBA) and other privileged administrative or application owner accounts are granted privileges that allow actions that can have a great impact on database security and operation. It is especially important to grant privileged access to only those persons who are qualified and authorized to use them.

This requirement is particularly important because Oracle equates the installation account with the SYS account - the super-DBA. Once logged on to the operating system, this account can connect to the database AS SYSDBA without further authentication. It is very powerful and, by virtue of not being linked to any one person, cannot be audited to the level of the individual.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Oracle Database 19c</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Oracle Database 19c</dc:subject><dc:identifier>5672</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-001499</ident><fixtext fixref="F-74450r1064825_fix">Develop, document, and implement procedures to restrict use of the DBMS software installation account.</fixtext><fix id="F-74450r1064825_fix" /><check system="C-74549r1064824_chk"><check-content-ref href="U_Oracle_Database_19c_V1R0-1_Manual-xccdf.xml" name="M" /><check-content>Review procedures for controlling and granting access to use of the database management system (DBMS) software installation account.

Multiple applications can provide a cumulative negative effect. A vulnerability and subsequent exploit to one application can lead to an exploit of other applications sharing the same security context. For example, an exploit to a web server process that leads to unauthorized administrative access to host system directories can most likely lead to a compromise of all applications hosted by the same system. Database software not installed using dedicated directories both threatens and is threatened by other hosted applications. Access controls defined for one application may by default provide access to the other application's database objects or directories.

As a policy, the listener can be administered only by the user who started it. 

Oracle Listener authentication is enforced through local operating system authentication. For example, if user1 starts the listener, then only user1 can administer it. Any other user trying to administer the listener receives an error. The super user is the only exception.

Remote administration of the listener must not be permitted. If listener administration from a remote system is required, granting secure remote access to the Oracle database management system (DBMS) server and performing local administration is preferred.

Determine all listeners running on the host.

For Windows hosts, view all Windows services with TNSListener embedded in the service name:

- The service name format is:
Oracle[ORACLE_HOME_NAME]TNSListener

For Unix hosts, the Oracle Listener process will indicate the TNSLSNR executable.

At a command prompt, issue the command:
ps -ef | grep tnslsnr | grep -v grep

The alias for the listener follows tnslsnr in the command output.

Must be logged on the host system using the account that owns the tnslsnr executable (Unix). If the account is denied local logon, have the system administrator (SA) assist in this task by adding "su" to the listener account from the root account. On Windows platforms, log on using an account with administrator privileges to complete the check.

From a system command prompt, execute the listener control utility:

lsnrctl status [LISTENER NAME]

Review the results for the value of Security.

If "Security = OFF" is displayed, this is a finding.

If "Security = ON: Password or Local OS Authentication", this is a finding (Instead, use Local OS Authentication).

If "Security = ON: Local OS Authentication" is displayed, this is not a finding.

Resource Parameters:

COMPOSITE_LIMIT - Specify the total resource cost for a session, expressed in service units. Oracle Database calculates the total service units as a weighted sum of CPU_PER_SESSION, CONNECT_TIME,
LOGICAL_READS_PER_SESSION, and PRIVATE_SGA.

SESSIONS_PER_USER - Specify the number of concurrent sessions to limit the user to.

CPU_PER_SESSION - Specify the CPU time limit for a session, expressed in hundredths of seconds.

CPU_PER_CALL - Specify the CPU time limit for a call (a parse, execute, or fetch), expressed in hundredths of seconds.

LOGICAL_READS_PER_SESSION - Specify the permitted number of data blocks read in a session, including blocks read from memory and disk.

LOGICAL_READS_PER_CALL - Specify the permitted number of data blocks read for a call to process a SQL statement (a parse, execute, or fetch).

PRIVATE_SGA - Specify the amount of private space a session can allocate in the shared pool of the system global area (SGA). Refer to size_clause for information on that clause.

CONNECT_TIME - Specify the total elapsed time limit for a session, expressed in minutes.

IDLE_TIME - Specify the permitted periods of continuous inactive time during a session, expressed in minutes. Long-running queries and other operations are not subject to this limit.

COMPOSITE_LIMIT - Refer to Oracle documentation for more details.

Password Parameters: Use the following clauses to set password parameters. Parameters that set lengths of time are interpreted in number of days. For testing purposes, specify minutes (n/1440) or even seconds (n/86400).

FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS - Specify the number of failed attempts to log on to the user account before the account is locked. If omitting this clause, then the default is 10.

PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME - Specify the number of days the same password can be used for authentication. If setting a value for PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME, then the password expires if it is not changed within the grace period, and further connections are rejected. If omitting this clause, then the default is 180 days.

PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME and PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX - These two parameters must be set in conjunction with each other. PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME specifies the number of days before which a password cannot be reused. PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX specifies the number of password changes required before the current password can be reused. For these parameters to have any effect, specify an integer for both of them.

If specifying a value for both of these parameters, then the user cannot reuse a password until the password has been changed the number of times specified for PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX during the number of days specified for PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME.

For example, if specifying PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME to 30 and PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX to 10, then the user can reuse the password after 30 days if the password has already been changed 10 times.

If specifying a value for either of these parameters and specify UNLIMITED for the other, then the user can never reuse a password.

If specifying DEFAULT for either parameter, then Oracle Database uses the value defined in the DEFAULT profile. By default, all parameters are set to UNLIMITED in the DEFAULT profile. If the default setting of UNLIMITED in the DEFAULT profile has not changed, then the database treats the value for that parameter as UNLIMITED.

If setting both of these parameters to UNLIMITED, then the database ignores both of them. This is the default if omitting both parameters.

PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME - Specify the number of days an account will be locked after the specified number of consecutive failed logon attempts. If omitting this clause, then the default is one day.

PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME - Specify the number of days after the grace period begins during which a warning is issued and logon is allowed. If omitting this clause, then the default is seven days.

PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION – This clause allows a PL/SQL password complexity verification script to be passed as an argument to the CREATE PROFILE statement. Oracle Database provides a default script, but users can create their own routine or use third-party software instead.</fixtext><fix id="F-74480r1068295_fix" /><check system="C-74579r1064914_chk"><check-content-ref href="U_Oracle_Database_19c_V1R0-1_Manual-xccdf.xml" name="M" /><check-content>If the organization has a policy, consistently enforced, forbidding the creation of emergency or temporary accounts, this is not a finding.

Owners of inactive DBMS accounts will not notice if unauthorized access to their user account has been obtained. All DBMS need to track periods of user inactivity and disable accounts after 35 days of inactivity. Such a process greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be hijacked, leading to a data compromise.

To address access requirements, some database administrators choose to integrate their databases with enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements. Such integration allows the database administrator to off-load those access control functions and focus on core application features and functionality. 

This policy does not apply to either emergency accounts or infrequently used accounts. Infrequently used accounts are local logon administrator accounts used by system administrators when network or normal logon/access is not available. Emergency accounts are administrator accounts created in response to crisis situations.

In Oracle 12c, Oracle introduced a new security parameter in the profile called INACTIVE_ACCOUNT_TIME. This parameter specifies the number of days permitted the account will be in OPEN state since the last login, after that will be LOCKED if no successful logins happens after the specified duration.

Check to verify what profile each user is associated with, if any, with this query:

select username, profile from dba_users order by 1,2;

Then, check the profile to verify what the inactive_account_time is set to in the table dba_profiles; the inactive_account_time is a value stored in the LIMIT column, and identified by the value inactive_account_time in the RESOURCE_NAME column.

SQL&gt;select profile, resource_name, resource_type, limit from dba_profiles where upper(resource_name) = 'INACTIVE_ACCOUNT_TIME';

If the INACTIVE_ACCOUNT_TIME parameter is set to UNLIMITED (default) or it is set to more than 35 days, this is a finding.

If INACTIVE_ACCOUNT_TIME is not a parameter associated with the profile, then check for a script or an automated job that is run daily that checks the audit trail or to ensure every user account has logged in within the last 35 days.

The inclusion of role is intended to address those situations where an access control policy, such as Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is being implemented and where a change of role provides the same degree of assurance in the change of access authorizations for both the user and all processes acting on behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between a privileged and nonprivileged account.

To limit exposure when operating from within a privileged account or role, the application must support organizational requirements that users of information system accounts, or roles, with access to organization-defined lists of security functions or security-relevant information, use nonprivileged accounts, or roles, when accessing other (nonsecurity) system functions.

Use of privileged accounts for nonadministrative purposes puts data at risk of unintended or unauthorized loss, modification, or exposure. In particular, database administrator (DBA) accounts if used for nonadministration application development or application maintenance can lead to miss-assignment of privileges where privileges are inherited by object owners.

In the Oracle database, the communications with the database and incoming requests are performed by the Oracle Listener. The Oracle Listener listens on a specific port or ports for connections to a specific database. The Oracle Listener has configuration files located in the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory.

A shared authenticator is a generic account used by multiple individuals. Use of a shared authenticator alone does not uniquely identify individual users. An example of a shared authenticator is the Unix OS "root" user account, a Windows "administrator" account, a "SA" account, or a "helpdesk" account.

For example, the Unix and Windows operating systems offer a "switch user" capability allowing users to authenticate with their individual credentials and, when needed, switch to the administrator role. This method provides for unique individual authentication prior to using a shared authenticator.

Some applications may not have the need to provide a group authenticator; this is considered a matter of application design. In those instances where the application design includes the use of a shared authenticator, this requirement will apply.

There may also be instances when specific user actions need to be performed on the information system without unique user identification or authentication. An example of this type of access is a web server which contains publicly releasable information. These types of accesses are allowed but must be explicitly identified and documented by the organization.

When shared accounts are used without another means of identifying individual users, users may deny having performed a particular action.

Oracle Access Manager may be helpful in meeting this requirement.

Oracle Access Manager is used when there is a need for multifactor authentication of applications front-ending Oracle Datasets that may use group accounts. Oracle Access Manager supports using PKI-based smart cards (CAC, PIV) for multifactor authentication. When a user authenticates to a smart card application, the smart card engine produces a certificate-based authentication token. Can configure a certificate-based authentication scheme in Oracle Access Manager that uses information from the smart card certificate. Certificate-based authentication works with any smart card or similar device that presents an X.509 certificate.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Oracle Database 19c</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Oracle Database 19c</dc:subject><dc:identifier>5672</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-000764</ident><fixtext fixref="F-74493r1064954_fix">Configure the DBMS, OS, and/or enterprise-level authentication/access mechanism to require individual authentication prior to authentication for shared account access.

The following are notes on implementing a Secure External Password Store using Oracle Wallet.

Oracle provides the capability to provide for a secure external password facility. Use the Oracle mkstore to create a secure storage area for passwords for applications, batch jobs, and scripts to use, or deploy a site-authorized facility to perform this function.

Check to verify what has been stored in the Oracle External Password Store.

To view all contents of a client wallet external password store, check specific credentials by viewing them. Listing the external password store contents provides information that can be used to decide whether to add or delete credentials from the store. To list the contents of the external password store, enter the following command at the command line:

$ mkstore -wrl wallet_location -listCredential

For example: $ mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\19.0.0\db_1\wallets -listCredential

The wallet_location specifies the path to the directory where the wallet, whose external password store contents is to be viewed, is located. This command lists all of the credential database service names (aliases) and the corresponding username (schema) for that database. Passwords are not listed.

Configuring Clients to Use the External Password Store:

If the client is already configured to use external authentication, such as Windows built-in authentication or Transport Layer Security (TLS), then Oracle Database uses that authentication method. The same credentials used for this type of authentication are typically also used to log on to the database.

For clients not using such authentication methods or wanting to override them for database authentication, can set the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter in sqlnet.ora to TRUE. The default value for SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE is FALSE, allowing standard use of authentication credentials as before.

If wanting a client to use the secure external password store feature, then perform the following configuration task:

1. Create a wallet on the client by using the following syntax at the command line:

mkstore -wrl wallet_location -create

For example: mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\19.0.0\db_1\wallets -create
Enter password: password

The wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet is to be created and stored. This command creates an Oracle wallet with the autologon feature enabled at the location specified. The autologon feature enables the client to access the wallet contents without supplying a password.

The mkstore utility -create option uses password complexity verification.

2. Create database connection credentials in the wallet by using the following syntax at the command line:

mkstore -wrl wallet_location -createCredential db_connect_string username
Enter password: password

For example: mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\19.0.0\db_1\wallets -createCredential oracle system
Enter password: password

In this specification, the wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet was created. The db_connect_string used in the CONNECT /@db_connect_string statement must be identical to the db_connect_string specified in the -createCredential command. The db_connect_string is the TNS alias used to specify the database in the tnsnames.ora file or any service name used to identify the database on an Oracle network. By default, tnsnames.ora is located in the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory on Unix systems and in ORACLE_HOME\network\admin on Windows. The username is the database logon credential. When prompted, enter the password for this user.

3. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the WALLET_LOCATION parameter and set it to the directory location of the wallet created in Step 1. For example, if the wallet was created in $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin and Oracle home is set to /private/ora19, then enter the following into client sqlnet.ora file:

WALLET_LOCATION =
(SOURCE =
(METHOD = FILE)
(METHOD_DATA =
(DIRECTORY = /private/ora19/network/admin)
)
)

4. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter and set it to TRUE as follows:

SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE

This setting causes all CONNECT /@db_connect_string statements to use the information in the wallet at the specified location to authenticate to databases.

When external authentication is in use, an authenticated user with such a wallet can use the CONNECT /@db_connect_string syntax to access the previously specified databases without providing a username and password. However, if a user fails that external authentication, then these connect statements also fail.

Below is a sample sqlnet.ora file with the WALLET_LOCATION and the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameters set as described in Steps 3 and 4.

WALLET_LOCATION =
(SOURCE =
(METHOD = FILE)
(METHOD_DATA =
(DIRECTORY = /private/ora19/network/admin)
)
)
SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE
SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION = FALSE
SSL_VERSION = 3.0

Note: This assumes that a single sqlnet.ora file, in the default location, is in use. Refer to the following link if using a nondefault configuration:

Normally, with PKI authentication, the interaction with the user for authentication will be handled by a software component separate from the database management system (DBMS), such as ActivIdentity ActivClient. However, in cases where the DBMS controls the interaction, this requirement applies.

To prevent the compromise of authentication information such as passwords and PINs during the authentication process, the feedback from the system must not provide any information that would allow an unauthorized user to compromise the authentication mechanism. 

Obfuscation of user-provided authentication secrets when typed into the system is a method used in addressing this risk. 

Displaying asterisks when a user types in a password or a smart card PIN is an example of obscuring feedback of authentication secrets.

This requires reviewing applications, which will involve collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers, and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored. At a minimum, the DBA must attempt to obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue has been addressed and must document what has been discovered.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Oracle Database 19c</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Oracle Database 19c</dc:subject><dc:identifier>5672</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-000206</ident><fixtext fixref="F-74502r1065292_fix">For Oracle SQL*Plus, which cannot be configured not to accept a plain-text password, and any other essential tool with the same limitation:

1. Document the need for it, who uses it, and any relevant mitigations, and obtain AO approval.
2. Train all users of the tool in the importance of not using the plain-text password option and in how to keep the password hidden.

Consider wrapping the startup command with a shell or wrapper and using an Oracle external password store.

Oracle provides the capability to provide for a secure external password facility. Use the Oracle mkstore to create a secure storage area for passwords for applications, batch jobs, and scripts to use or deploy a site-authorized facility to perform this function.

Check to verify what has been stored in the Oracle External Password Store.

To view all contents of a client wallet external password store, check specific credentials by viewing them. Listing the external password store contents provides information used to decide whether to add or delete credentials from the store. To list the contents of the external password store, enter the following command at the command line:

$ mkstore -wrl wallet_location -listCredential

For example:

$ mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\19.0.0\db_1\wallets -listCredential

The wallet_location specifies the path to the directory where the wallet, whose external password store contents is to be viewed, is located. This command lists all of the credential database service names (aliases) and the corresponding username (schema) for that database. Passwords are not listed.

Configuring Clients to Use the External Password Store

If the client is already configured to use external authentication, such as Windows native authentication or Transport Layer Security (TLS), then Oracle Database uses that authentication method. The same credentials used for this type of authentication are typically also used to log on to the database.

For clients not using such authentication methods or wanting to override them for database authentication, set the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter in sqlnet.ora to TRUE. The default value for SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE is FALSE, allowing standard use of authentication credentials as before.

If wanting a client to use the secure external password store feature, then perform the following configuration task:

1. Create a wallet on the client by using the following syntax at the command line:
orapki create -wallet wallet_location -auto_login_local

For example:
orapki wallet create -wallet c:\oracle\product\19.0.0\db_1\wallets -auto_login_local
Enter password: password

The wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet is to be created and stored. This command creates an Oracle wallet with the autologon feature enabled at the location specified. The autologon feature enables the client to access the wallet contents without supplying a password.

The mkstore utility -create option uses password complexity verification.

2. Create database connection credentials in the wallet by using the following syntax at the command line:
mkstore -wrl wallet_location -createCredential db_connect_string username
Enter password: password

For example:
mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\19.0.0\db_1\wallets -createCredential oracle system
Enter password: password

In this specification:
The wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet was created. The db_connect_string used in the CONNECT /@db_connect_string statement must be identical to the db_connect_string specified in the -createCredential command.

The db_connect_string is the TNS alias used to specify the database in the tnsnames.ora file or any service name used to identify the database on an Oracle network. By default, tnsnames.ora is located in the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory on Unix systems and in ORACLE_HOME\network\admin on Windows.

The username is the database logon credential. When prompted, enter the password for this user.

3. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the WALLET_LOCATION parameter and set it to the directory location of the wallet created in Step 1. For example, if the wallet was created in $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin and the Oracle home is set to /private/ora12, then need to enter the following into the client sqlnet.ora file:

WALLET_LOCATION =
(SOURCE =
(METHOD = FILE)
(METHOD_DATA =
(DIRECTORY = /private/ora19/network/admin)
)
)

4. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter and set it to TRUE as follows:

SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE

This setting causes all CONNECT /@db_connect_string statements to use the information in the wallet at the specified location to authenticate to databases.

When external authentication is in use, an authenticated user with such a wallet can use the CONNECT /@db_connect_string syntax to access the previously specified databases without providing a username and password. However, if a user fails that external authentication, then these connect statements also fail.

Below is a sample sqlnet.ora file with the WALLET_LOCATION and the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameters set as described in Steps 3 and 4.

Below is a sample SQLNET.ORA File with wallet parameters set.

WALLET_LOCATION =
(SOURCE =
(METHOD = FILE)
(METHOD_DATA =
(DIRECTORY = /private/ora19/network/admin)
)
)

SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE
SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION = FALSE
SSL_VERSION = 3.0

Note: This assumes that a single sqlnet.ora file, in the default location, is in use. Refer to the following link if using a nondefault configuration:

Weak algorithms can be easily broken and not validated cryptographic modules may not implement algorithms correctly. Unapproved cryptographic modules or algorithms should not be relied on for authentication, confidentiality, or integrity. Weak cryptography could allow an attacker to gain access to and modify data stored in the database as well as the administration settings of the database management system (DBMS).

Applications (including DBMSs) using cryptography are required to use approved NIST FIPS 140-2/140-3 validated cryptographic modules that meet the requirements of applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.

NSA Type-X (where X=1, 2, 3, 4) products are NSA-certified, hardware-based encryption modules.

The standard for validating cryptographic modules will transition to the NIST FIPS 140-3 publication.

FIPS 140-2 modules can remain active for up to five years after validation or until September 21, 2026, when the FIPS 140-2 validations will be moved to the historical list. Even on the historical list, CMVP supports the purchase and use of these modules for existing systems. While federal agencies decide when they move to FIPS 140-3 only modules, purchasers are reminded that for several years there may be a limited selection of FIPS 140-3 modules from which to choose. CMVP recommends purchasers consider all modules that appear on the Validated Modules Search Page:

Oracle recommends using Transparent Data Encryption, which is part of Oracle Advanced Security Option, to protect data.

To check to verify the data is encrypted, for example, upon an auditor's request Oracle provides views that document the encryption status of the database. For TDE column encryption, use the view "dba_encrypted_columns", which lists the owner, table name, column name, encryption algorithm, and salt for all encrypted columns. For TDE tablespace encryption, the following SQL statement lists all encrypted tablespaces with their encryption algorithm and corresponding, encrypted, data files. Issue the following commands to check to verify the data at rest is encrypted.

$ sqlplus connect as sysdba

Alternative physical protection measures include Protected Distribution Systems (PDS). PDS are used to transmit unencrypted classified NSI through an area of lesser classification or control.

This results in unanticipated application behavior, potentially leading to an application or information system compromise. Invalid user input is one of the primary methods employed when attempting to compromise an application.

All applications need to validate the data users attempt to input to the application for processing. Rules for checking the valid syntax and semantics of information system inputs (e.g., character set, length, numerical range, acceptable values) are in place to verify inputs match specified definitions for format and content. Inputs passed to interpreters are prescreened to prevent the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands.

This requires for inspection of application source code, which will involve collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored. At a minimum, the DBA must attempt to obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue has been addressed and must document what has been discovered.

Oracle provides built-in processes to keep data and its integrity intact by using constraints.

Integrity Constraint States can specify that a constraint is enabled (ENABLE) or disabled (DISABLE). If a constraint is enabled, data is checked as it is entered or updated in the database, and data that does not conform to the constraint is prevented from being entered. If a constraint is disabled, then data that does not conform can be allowed to enter the database.

Additionally, can specify that existing data in the table must conform to the constraint (VALIDATE). Conversely, if specified NOVALIDATE, are not ensured that existing data conforms.

An integrity constraint defined on a table can be in one of the following states:
ENABLE, VALIDATE
ENABLE, NOVALIDATE
DISABLE, VALIDATE
DISABLE, NOVALIDATE&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Oracle Database 19c</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Oracle Database 19c</dc:subject><dc:identifier>5672</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-001310</ident><fixtext fixref="F-74514r1068299_fix">Modify database code to properly validate data before it is put into the database or acted upon by the database.

Review the application schemas implemented on the system. Check the DDL for the tables that are created for the applications to verify constraints have been enabled.

Enabling Constraints Upon Definition: The following CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements both define and enable integrity constraints:
CREATE TABLE emp (
empno NUMBER(5) CONSTRAINT emp.pk PRIMARY KEY, . . . ) ;
ALTER TABLE emp
ADD CONSTRAINT emp.pk PRIMARY KEY (empno);

An ALTER TABLE statement that defines and attempts to enable an integrity constraint can fail because existing rows of the table violate the integrity constraint. In this case, the statement is rolled back, and the constraint definition is not stored and not enabled.

When enabling a UNIQUE or PRIMARY KEY constraint, an associated index is created.  

For details about the meaning of these states and an understanding of their consequences, refer to the Oracle Database SQL Language Reference. Some of these consequences are discussed here.

Disabling Constraints: To enforce the rules defined by integrity constraints, the constraints should always be enabled. However, consider temporarily disabling the integrity constraints of a table for the following performance reasons:

- When loading large amounts of data into a table;

- When performing batch operations that make massive changes to a table (for example, changing every employee's number by adding 1000 to the existing number); or

- When importing or exporting one table at a time.

In all three cases, temporarily disabling integrity constraints can improve the performance of the operation, especially in data warehouse configurations.

It is possible to enter data that violates a constraint while that constraint is disabled. Thus, always enable the constraint after completing any of the operations listed in the preceding bullet list.

Enabling Constraints: While a constraint is enabled, no row violating the constraint can be inserted into the table. However, while the constraint is disabled, such a row can be inserted. This row is known as an exception to the constraint. If the constraint is in the ENABLE, NOVALIDATE state, violations resulting from data entered while the constraint was disabled remain. The rows that violate the constraint must be either updated or deleted in order for the constraint to be put in the validated state.

Can identify exceptions to a specific integrity constraint while attempting to enable the constraint. Refer to "Reporting Constraint Exceptions". All rows violating constraints are noted in an EXCEPTIONS table, which can be examined.

ENABLE, NOVALIDATE Constraint State: When a constraint is in the ENABLE, NOVALIDATE state, all subsequent statements are checked for conformity to the constraint. However, any existing data in the table is not checked. A table with ENABLE, NOVALIDATE constraints can contain invalid data, but it is not possible to add new invalid data to it. Constraints in the ENABLE, NOVALIDATE state is most useful in data warehouse configurations that are uploading valid OLTP data.

Enabling a constraint does not require validation. Enabling a constraint NOVALIDATE is much faster than enabling and validating a constraint. Also, validating a constraint that is already enabled does not require any DML locks during validation (unlike validating a previously disabled constraint). Enforcement guarantees that no violations are introduced during the validation. Hence, enabling without validating reduces the downtime typically associated with enabling a constraint.

Efficient Use of Integrity Constraints: A Procedure:
Using integrity constraint states in the following order can ensure the best benefits:
- Disable state.
- Perform the operation (load, export, import).
- ENABLE, NOVALIDATE state.
- Enable state.

Some benefits of using constraints in this order are:
- No locks are held.
- All constraints can go to enable state concurrently.
- Constraint enabling is done in parallel.
- Concurrent activity on table is permitted.

Setting Integrity Constraints Upon Definition: When an integrity constraint is defined in a CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement, it can be enabled, disabled, or validated or not validated as determined by the specification of the ENABLE/DISABLE clause. If the ENABLE/DISABLE clause is not specified in a constraint definition, the database automatically enables and validates the constraint.

Disabling Constraints Upon Definition: The following CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements both define and disable integrity constraints:

CREATE TABLE emp (
empno NUMBER(5) PRIMARY KEY DISABLE, . . . ;

ALTER TABLE emp
ADD PRIMARY KEY (empno) DISABLE;

An ALTER TABLE statement that defines and disables an integrity constraint never fails because of rows in the table that violate the integrity constraint. The definition of the constraint is allowed because its rule is not enforced.

Enabling Constraints Upon Definition:

The following CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements both define and enable integrity constraints:

CREATE TABLE emp (
empno NUMBER(5) CONSTRAINT emp.pk PRIMARY KEY, . . . ;

ALTER TABLE emp
ADD CONSTRAINT emp.pk PRIMARY KEY (empno);

An ALTER TABLE statement that defines and attempts to enable an integrity constraint can fail because rows of the table violate the integrity constraint. If this case, the statement is rolled back, and the constraint definition is not stored and not enabled.</fixtext><fix id="F-74514r1068299_fix" /><check system="C-74613r1065016_chk"><check-content-ref href="U_Oracle_Database_19c_V1R0-1_Manual-xccdf.xml" name="M" /><check-content>Review database management system (DBMS) code, settings, field definitions, constraints, and triggers to determine whether or not data being input into the database is validated.

The principal protection against code injection is not to use dynamic execution except where it provides necessary functionality that cannot be used otherwise. Use strongly typed data items rather than general purpose strings as input parameters to task-specific, precompiled stored procedures and functions (and triggers).

When dynamic execution is necessary, ways to mitigate the risk include the following, which should be implemented both in the on-screen application and at the database level, in the stored procedures:
- Allow strings as input only when necessary. 
- Rely on data typing to validate numbers, dates, etc. Do not accept invalid values. If substituting other values for them, think carefully about whether this could be subverted.
- Limit the size of input strings to what is truly necessary.
- If single quotes/apostrophes, double quotes, semicolons, equals signs, angle brackets, or square brackets will never be valid as input, reject them.
- If comment markers will never be valid as input, reject them. In SQL, these are -- or /* */ 
- If HTML and XML tags, entities, comments, etc., will never be valid, reject them.
- If wildcards are present, reject them unless truly necessary. In SQL these are the underscore and the percentage sign, and the word ESCAPE is also a clue that wildcards are in use.
- If SQL key words, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP, ESCAPE, UNION, GRANT, REVOKE, DENY, MODIFY will never be valid, reject them. Use case-insensitive comparisons when searching for these. Bear in mind that some of these words, particularly Grant (as a person's name), could also be valid input. 
- If there are range limits on the values that may be entered, enforce those limits.
- Institute procedures for inspection of programs for correct use of dynamic coding, by a party other than the developer.
- Conduct rigorous testing of program modules that use dynamic coding, searching for ways to subvert the intended use.
- Record the inspection and testing in the system documentation.
- Bear in mind that all this applies not only to screen input, but also to the values in an incoming message to a web service or to a stored procedure called by a software component that has not itself been hardened in these ways. Not only can the caller be subject to such vulnerabilities; it may itself be the attacker.

Out of the box, Oracle Database covers this. For example, if a user does not have access to a table, the error is just that the table or view does not exist. The Oracle Database is not going to display a Social Security Number in an error code unless an application is programmed to do so.

Configure the password verify function to verify when users create or update passwords, that the passwords are not found on the list of commonly-used, expected, or compromised passwords in IA-5 (1) (a).

Oracle supplies a sample function called ORA12C_STRONG_VERIFY_FUNCTION. This can be used as the starting point for a customized function. The script file is found in the following location on the server depending on OS:

Windows:
%ORACLE_HOME%\RDBMS\ADMIN\catpvf.sql

If all user accounts are authenticated by the OS or an enterprise-level authentication/access mechanism, and not by Oracle, this is not a finding.

For each profile that can be applied to accounts where authentication is under Oracle's control, determine the password verification function that is in use:

SELECT * FROM SYS.DBA_PROFILES 
WHERE RESOURCE_NAME = 'PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION'
ORDER BY PROFILE;

Note: Profiles can inherit settings from another profile so some password functions could be set to DEFAULT. If so, review the DEFAULT profile function name. 

If the function name is null for any profile, this is a finding.

Review the password verification functions specified for the PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION settings for each profile. Determine whether it is configured for when users create or update passwords, that the passwords are not found on the list of commonly-used, expected, or compromised passwords.

Verify the database management system (DBMS) is configured to include only approved trust anchors in trust stores or certificate stores managed by the organization.

If trust stores or certification paths are not being validated back to a trust anchor, this is a finding.

The database supports PKI-based authentication by using digital certificates over Transport Layer Security (TLS) in addition to the native encryption and data integrity capabilities of these protocols.

Oracle provides a complete PKI that is based on RSA Security, Inc., Public-Key Cryptography Standards, and which interoperates with Oracle servers and clients. The database uses a wallet that is a container that is used to store authentication and signing credentials, including private keys, certificates, and trusted certificates needed by TLS. In an Oracle environment, every entity that communicates over TLS must have a wallet containing an X.509 version 3 certificate, private key, and list of trusted certificates.

If the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/sqlnet.ora contains the following entries, TLS is installed.

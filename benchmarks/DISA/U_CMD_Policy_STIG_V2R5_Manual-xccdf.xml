This requirement applies to mobile operating system (OS) CMDs.

This requirement also applies to sensitive DoD information stored on mobile OS devices that are not authorized to connect to DoD networks or store/process sensitive DoD information. Sensitive DoD data or information is defined as any data/information that has not been approved for public release by the site/Command Public Affairs Officer (PAO).

In accordance with DoD policy, all components must establish Incident Handling and Response procedures. A CMI or “data spill” occurs when a classified email is inadvertently sent on an unclassified network and received on a wireless email device. Classified information may also be transmitted through some other form of file transfer to include web browser downloads and files transferred through tethered connections. CMDs are not authorized for processing classified data. 

A data spill also occurs if a classified document is attached to an otherwise unclassified email. For BlackBerry and Good Mobile Messaging systems, a data spill will only occur if the classified attached document is viewed or opened by the CMD user since the CMD system only downloads an attachment on the CMD if the user views or opens the attachment. The site's Incident Handling and Response procedures should reference NSA/CSS Storage Device Declassification Manual 9-12, Section 5, for smartphone destruction procedures. 

Check Procedures: 
Interview the ISSO. Verify classified incident handling, response, and reporting procedures are documented in site CMD procedures or security policies. If classified incident handling, response, and reporting procedures are not documented in site CMD procedures or security policies, this is a finding.

This requirement applies at both sites where CMDs are issued and managed and at sites where the CMD management server is located.

- At the CMD management server site, verify Incident Handling and Response procedures include actions to sanitize the CMD management server and email servers (e.g., Exchange, Oracle mail). 

- At CMD sites, verify Incident Handling and Response procedures include actions for incident reporting and actions to safeguard classified smartphone devices. The following actions will be followed for all CMDs involved in a data spill:

If a data spill occurs on a CMD, the following actions must be completed: 

- The CMD management server and email servers (i.e., Exchange, Oracle mail, etc.) are handled as classified systems until they are sanitized according to appropriate procedures. (See NSA/CSS Storage Device Declassification Manual 9-12 for sanitization procedures.)

- The CMD is handled as a classified device and destroyed according to DoD guidance for destroying classified equipment or sanitized as directed in Check WIR-SPP-003-01. 

Check Procedures: 
Interview the ISSO. Determine if the site has had a data spill within the previous 24 months. If yes, review written records, incident reports, and/or after action reports and determine if required procedures were followed. 

If the site had a data spill within the previous 24 months and required procedures were not followed, this is a finding.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-24958"><title>Follow procedures for disposal of CMDs</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-30695r6_rule" severity="low" weight="10.0"><version>WIR-SPP-004</version><title>Required procedures must be followed for the disposal of CMDs.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;If appropriate procedures are not followed prior to disposal of a CMD, an adversary may be able to obtain sensitive DoD information or learn aspects of the configuration of the device that might facilitate a subsequent attack.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;System Administrator&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Smartphone Handheld Policy</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Smartphone Handheld Policy</dc:subject><dc:identifier>1978</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-27586r3_fix">Follow required procedures prior to disposing of a CMD or transitioning it to another user.</fixtext><fix id="F-27586r3_fix" /><check system="C-31118r8_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_CMD Policy STIG.xml" /><check-content>This requirement applies to mobile operating system (OS) CMDs.

This requirement applies to mobile operating system (OS) CMDs.

All mobile device users must receive required training on the following topics before they are provided a mobile device or allowed access to DoD networks with a mobile device. Training is divided into two groups: Group A (general topics) and Group B (device specific topics). DISA’s Smartphones and Tablets security course satisfies the requirement for Group A training topics. The course is located at: http://iase.disa.mil/eta/smartphone_tablet_v1/launchpage.htm.

a. Requirement that personally-owned PEDs are not used to transmit, receive, store, or process DoD information unless approved by the AO and the owner signs forfeiture agreement in case of a security incident.

b. Procedures for wireless device usage in and around classified processing areas.

c. Requirement that PEDs with digital cameras (still and video) are not allowed in any SCIF or other areas where classified documents or information is stored, transmitted, or processed.

d. Procedures for a data spill. 

e. Requirement that Over-The-Air (OTA) wireless software updates should only come from DoD-approved sources. 

f. When CMD Wi-Fi Service is used, the following training will be completed: 
- Procedures for setting up a secure Wi-Fi connection and verifying the active connection is to a known access point. 

- Approved connection options (i.e., enterprise, home, etc.). 

- Requirements for home Wi-Fi connections. 

- The Wi-Fi radio will be disabled by the user whenever a Wi-Fi connection is not being used.

- The Wi-Fi radio must never be enabled while the CMD is connected via a cable to a PC.

g. Do not discuss FOUO or classified information on non-secure (devices whose cryptographic modules protecting data in transit are not FIPS 140-2 certified or NSA Type-1 certified for voice) cellular phones, cordless phones, and two-way radios used for voice communications. 

h. Do not connect PDAs, smartphones, and tablets to any workstation that stores, processes, or transmits classified data.. 

i. The installation of user owned applications, including geo-location aware applications, on the mobile device will be based on the Command’s Mobile Device Personal Use Policy.

j. The use of the mobile OS device to view and/or download personal email will be based the Command’s Mobile Device Personal Use Policy.

k. The download of user owned data (music files, picture files, etc.) on the mobile device will be based the Command’s Mobile Device Personal Use Policy.

l. All radios on the mobile device (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, near-field communications (NFC)) must be turned off when not needed. This does not apply to radios supporting voice and data communication over a wireless carrier’s cellular network, in which case continuous connectivity is permissible.

m. Procedure on how to disable Location Services on the device. Location Services must be disabled for all applications or enabled only for applications approved by the AO for location based services.

n. Connecting PDAs, smartphones, and tablets to any DoD workstation via a USB connection is prohibited. 

Note: Listing training requirements in the User Agreement is an acceptable procedure for informing/training users on many of the required training topics. 

Check Procedures: 
- Review site CMD training material to see if it contains the required content. 
Note: Some training content may be listed in the User Agreement signed by the user. 

- Verify site training records show that CMD users received required training and training occurred before the user was issued a CMD. Check training records for approximately five users, picked at random.

The site (location where CMDs are issued and managed and the site where the mobile operating system (OS) based CMD management server is located) must publish procedures to follow if a CMD has been lost or stolen. The procedures should include (as appropriate):

- Mobile device user notifies ISSO, SM, and other site personnel, as required by the site’s Incident Response Plan, within the timeframe required by the site’s Incident Response Plan. 

- The ISSO notifies the mobile device management server system administrator and other site personnel, as required by the site’s Incident Response Plan, within the timeframe required by the site’s Incident Response Plan. 

The site mobile device management server administrator sends a wipe command to the CMD and then disables the user account on the management server or removes the CMD from the user account.

- The site will contact the carrier to have the device deactivated on the carrier’s network.

Check procedures: 
Interview the ISSO. 

Review the site’s Incident Response Plan or other policies to determine if the site has a written plan of action.

If the site does not have a written plan of action following a lost or stolen CMD, this is a finding.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-24963"><title>CMD provisioning-01</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-30700r5_rule" severity="low" weight="10.0"><version>WIR-SPP-008-01</version><title>The mobile device system administrator must perform a wipe command on all new or reissued CMDs and a STIG-compliant IT policy will be pushed to the device before issuing it to DoD personnel.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Malware can be installed on the device at some point between shipping from the factory and delivery to DoD.

Core applications are applications included in the mobile device operating system. Applications added by the wireless carrier are not considered core applications. A security risk analysis must be performed by the AO or AO-approved approval authority prior to a mobile OS application being approved for use.

- The application review and approval process must include an evaluation of what OS level permissions are required by the application and how the application shares data and memory space with other applications. The review process must also ensure:
- Approved applications do not contain malware or share data stored on the mobile OS device with non-DoD servers.

Check Procedures:



Ask the site for documentation showing what security risk analysis procedures are used by the AO prior to approving non-core applications for use.

Determine if the procedures include an evaluation of the following:
- What OS level permissions are required by the application? 
- The application does not contain malware.
- The application does not share data stored on the CMDs with non-DoD servers.
- If the application stores sensitive data, the application data storage container uses FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic module.

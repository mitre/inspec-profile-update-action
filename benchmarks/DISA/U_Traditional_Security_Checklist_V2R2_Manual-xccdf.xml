Specific standards are: 
1. Keyed crypto equipment must be housed within a proper GSA safe, vault or secure room. 
2. If crypto equipment is not housed within a proper GSA safe, vault or secure room the Crypto Encryption Key must be removed and stored in a GSA approved safe or in a separate room from the crypto equipment when the equipment is not under the continuous observation and control of a properly cleared person. 
3. Information Processing System (IPS) containers (safes) may be used to securely store and operate keyed equipment. 
4. If unclassified crypto equipment is not operated in a safe, vault or secure room it must minimally be maintained within an approved Secret or higher Controlled Access Area (CAA) and further secured in a locked room (equipment closet) or equipment rack suitable for control of sensitive equipment to ensure only system administrator and COMSEC personnel have access to the equipment. 
5. NOTES: This requirement applies to a tactical environment. Unless under continuous observation and control, Crypto Equipment Key must be removed and maintained separately from the encryption device - unless it is operated in a proper safe, vault or secure room.  Ensure that any COMSEC account, materials or equipment being inspected is used for encryption of DoDIN assets.  COMSEC items not used with DoDIN assets should not be inspected.

NOTES:

1. Applies in a tactical environment if the crypto equipment and key material being observed is at a location where supporting staff (IAM, SM, COMSEC Custodian) would logically be located. If it is a mobile tactical organization, responsibility for program management might simply be the identification of an individual responsible for keeping track of and maintaining COMSEC materials, but supporting documentation may not be immediately available and should not be written as a finding; however, observations and comments may still be documented. 

2. Note in the report the COMSEC Account type e.g. NSA, Navy, Army, etc. 

3. Note in the report the last COMSEC Inspection Date based on observed documentation. (Summarize the overall results and if the site is taking action to address/correct findings.) 

4. Ensure that any COMSEC account, materials or equipment being inspected is used for encryption of DoDIN assets. COMSEC accounts or items not used with DoDIN assets should not be inspected.

5. This check is not intended to be an  inspection of the COMSEC Program, rather it is a verification that a viable program is in place with NSA or oversight. The idea is to ensure that NSA or Service oversight inspection findings/deficiencies are being corrected in a timely manner by the site.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-245725"><title>CS-02.02.01</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-245725r822792_rule" weight="10.0" severity="medium"><version>CS-02.02.01</version><title>COMSEC Training - COMSEC Custodian or Hand Receipt Holder</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Lack of appropriate training for managers of COMSEC accounts could result in the mismanagement of COMSEC records, inadequate physical protection and ultimately lead to the loss or compromise of COMSEC keying material.

All of the following requirements must be met:

1. The PDS must originate within the room or area containing the SIPRNet Point of Presence (PoP) for the facility or area, which must be in a Secret or above Secure Room, Vault, SCIF or alternatively in an Information Processing Systems (IPS) Container with SIPRNet connected equipment (router/switch/PC/laptop/multi-function device (e.g., printer, copier, fax)).  An IPS container is a specially designed safe for secured operation of classified network and end user equipment.
   
2. PDS terminal equipment (wall jacks/ports) must be located in a Secret or higher Controlled Access Area (CAA), Secret or higher vault, Secret or higher Secure Room or in a SCIF.

3. PDS terminating in areas not a Secret or higher CAA (SCAA) may alternatively terminate in an IPS Container with SIPRNet connected equipment (router/switch/PC/laptop/multi-function device (printer, copier, and fax)).
  
4. If an IPS container is used to secure equipment at a PDS termination point, it must be located within at least a Limited Access Area (LAA).  *It cannot ever be located in an Uncontrolled Access Area (UAA).

5. In exceptional situations, when the PDS termination area cannot be access controlled to the level of the data carried by the PDS (e.g., in a multi-use conference room), the PDS termination point (wall jack/port) must be secured with a lock box. Access Controlled to the level of the data carried by the PDS for SIPRNet connections means the PDS termination area must minimally be a secret CAA (SCAA).  The lock box must meet the same construction requirements as a pull box for the PDS carrier type.  *Specifications for pull boxes and termination lock boxes are covered in rule:  Protected Distribution System (PDS) Construction - Accessible Pull Box Security, STIG ID: CS-04.01.03, Rule ID: SV-41000r3_rule Vuln ID: V-30958.  A finding for deficient pull box or termination lock box construction should be cited under STIG ID: CS-04.01.03.

6.  If a lock box is used to secure a PDS termination/end point (wall jack/port), it must be located within at least a Limited Access Area (LAA).  *It cannot ever be located in an Uncontrolled Access Area (UAA).

7.  PDS lock boxes located within a LAA must be physically disconnected (cables pulled) from equipment and the lock boxes secured with an approved PDS lock when the lock box is not under the continuous observation and control of a properly cleared person (secret security clearance for SIPRNet). 

NOTES: 

Access to all PDS points with breakouts must be restricted to personnel cleared at the highest level of the breakout and therefore, the PDS terminal equipment (end point) must either be locked or continuously safeguarded by cleared persons to prevent tampering.

The S&amp;G 8077 changeable combination padlock is the DoD standard/required PDS lock for user termination lock boxes that are opened/closed on a routine or frequent basis.

1. Box covers must not have removable hinge pins. The hinge must be hidden or mechanically blocked to prevent removal.
 
2. If the pull box will be accessed after installation, the pull box cover must be secured with an approved PDS lock. Multiple locks may be required for larger pull-boxes.
  
NOTE 1: The ONLY approved PDS Lock within the DoD is the General Services Administration (GSA) approved changeable combination padlock and has historically been the lock used for securing accessible pull boxes and PDS termination boxes. The only padlock currently meeting this standard is the S&amp;G 8077, changeable combination padlock.

NOTE 2: A newer alternative PDS lock listed by the CNSSI 7003 is the tamper indicative padlock with a wire loop seal. This is a "keyed" padlock with an attached seal that is issued exclusively by the lock proponent, which is the National Security Agency (NSA) Information Assurance Division (IAD) Lock and Seal Office.  The USD(I) has determined this lock will not be used for protecting PDS Pull Boxes within the DoD. 
 
NOTE 3: The new CNSSI 7003 under the PDS Lock definition identified the wrong federal specification for the changeable combination padlock.  The lock identified under FF-L-2740B is designed for safes and will not fit properly on a small PDS lock box.  The correct lock (S&amp;G 8077 changeable combination padlock) is under the FF-P-110J federal specification.  That is what the CNSSI 7003 proponent "intended" and the DoD TEMPEST Advisory Group (TAG) and NSA Protective Technologies Group are taking action to coordinate correction of this oversight.

3. Hasps (used with PDS locks) to secure the cover on the pull box must be permanently and securely attached to the box (e.g., tack welded or with rivets) in such a way as it cannot be removed without breaking the hasp or its connection.
  
4. Boxes with prepunched knockouts must not be used.

5. Ensure that for medium threat areas (as defined in the CNSSI 7003), pull boxes are constructed of a ferrous metal with a minimum thickness of 14 gauge and must have a cover that can be locked. However, the material need not be thicker than the PDS carrier or the thickness needed for box rigidity.

6. Ensure that for low threat areas (as defined in the CNSSI 7003), pull boxes are constructed of a ferrous metal with a minimum thickness of 16 gauge.

If pull box covers are NOT capable of being opened or used for accessing the transmission cable, the following 4 requirements apply:
 
7. Covers must be secured to the pull boxes by welding or epoxy after installation as follows: 
  - If welded, at least one weld must be applied on each side of the box and cover. 
  - If epoxy is used, it must be applied between all mating surfaces continuously around the cover. 
  - Painted surfaces must be treated to form a mechanically strong epoxy bond.

8. Hinge-pins for pull-box covers must be non-removable. The hinge must be hidden or mechanically blocked to prevent removal.
 
9. Boxes with pre-punched knockouts must not be used under any circumstances.
 
10. For low threat areas (as defined in the CNSSI 7003), pull boxes are constructed of a ferrous metal with a minimum thickness of 16 gauge.

NOTE: Pull boxes located in medium threat areas must have a lockable cover and are therefore addressed in requirement #5 above under pull box covers capable of being opened and used for accessing the transmission cable.

1. Ensure the buried carrier is constructed of conduit consisting of EMT, rigid pipe, PVC, or a similar type of plastic electrical conduit.
  
2. Ensure all connections are permanently sealed completely around all mating surfaces (e.g., welding, epoxy, fusion, or PVC glue).
  
3. Ensure the PDS is buried a minimum of 1 meter (39 inches) below the surface and on the property (in a LOW Threat area within CONUS) owned or leased by the U.S. Government or the contractor having control of the PDS.

NOTE: As an alternative, if the carrier cannot be buried to a one-meter depth due to soil conditions or blocked passage, a lesser depth may be used within a low threat area with prior approval of the Authorizing Official (AO) if the carrier is encased within the center of mass of approximately 20 centimeters (8 inches) of concrete.
 
4. Ensure the buried carrier departs and enters a building through the building's concrete slab or basement wall.

NOTE: As an alternative, all portions of the PDS above the 1 meter (39 inches) depth and not within a CAA (e.g., a PDS rising to a pull box on the side of a building) must meet the requirements of a Category 2 hardened carrier.
   
5. Ensure that manholes or any other access (e.g., hand hole) to the buried PDS are secured with a PDS lock or an alarm. The PDS lock must be visible for daily inspection. If a PDS lock cannot be used due to the physical construction of the manhole, then a standard locking manhole cover and micro-switch alarm should be used.

NOTE: As an alternative to a PDS lock or approved micro-switch alarms, manhole covers may be completely welded around the opening surface to impede opening and provide for clear evidence of penetration. Spot-welding is not acceptable. If operational security needs dictate exceeding the STIG requirements, the site is always free to expand upon and increase their security posture by welding manhole covers. However, prior to this alternative method being instituted, the site must conduct and document an in-depth THREAT Assessment for their AOR and the assessment requires Senior Agency Official approval. This approval will be maintained on file. Also, daily visual inspections are still required per CNSSI 7003, Section X, para b. 3.  (CAT I finding).

NOTE: The USD(I) Policy has determined the PDS Locks referred to in the CNSSI 7003 as Tamper Indicative Padlock with a wire loop seal and Tamper Evident Seal ARE NOT permitted for use in the DoD.

NOTE: A concrete and steel container of sufficient size (to preclude surreptitious penetration in a period less than two hours as confirmed by laboratory tests) may be used in lieu of the 20 centimeters (8 inches) of concrete. (CAT I finding)

NOTE for Reviewers: If portions of the buried carrier cannot be checked due to being physically inaccessible, conduct whatever physical review is possible and attempt to validate PDS construction by reviewing contract/build documents, engineering drawings or certification documents from installation engineers that contain information about the physical makeup of the buried carrier.

Suspended carriers may be used for short runs when it is not practical to bury the PDS between buildings (e.g., between the 3rd floors of adjacent buildings).  Unlike other Category 2 PDS the unencrypted data cables are not required to be installed in a carrier. Proper elevation and ease of visibility as well as minimum daily visual inspections of suspended carriers is of paramount importance.  A PDS that is not configured, physically secured and inspected as required could result in the undetected interception of classified information.  This is especially true for unencrypted cables running through an outdoor environment where physical barriers protecting the environment are often easily breeched.

Ensure unencrypted SIPRNet data cables are installed in a carrier properly configured as an "Alarmed Carrier" IAW the following guidelines: 

1. Ideally the carrier will be constructed of solid electrical metallic tubing (EMT), ferrous conduit or pipe, or rigid-sheet steel ducting, utilizing elbows, couplings, nipples, and connectors of the same material. Connectors need not be permanently sealed in an alarmed carrier.  As a minimum the carrier may consist of any material equal to or better than standards for a "Simple PDS" (e.g., wood, PVT, EMT, ferrous conduit.  The key to determining the appropriateness of a PDS carrier is its suitability for supporting the functionality of the approved alarm sensor, which provides a means to detect tampering and/or breach of the actual PDS carrier - *not a breach of the space surrounding the carrier.  An IDS sensor capable of detecting changes in carrier air pressure is an example of an acceptable detection methodology.

2. As an alternative to an alarmed carrier, the space surrounding the entire carrier may be covered by an area or volumetric (e.g., infrared, motion detection) alarm system.
 
3. The carrier and/or volumetric alarm system sensor employed must be approved by the cognizant physical security authorities.  Documentation must exist to support this approval.
 
4. The alarm system and signal transmission must be part of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) meeting the requirements of the Appendix to Enclosure 3 of DoD Manual 5200.01, V3 (INFOSEC - Protection of Classified Information). For instance: The alarm must provide protection from tampering and be able to register malfunctions. The alarm system must also transmit a line fault message to the annunciator panel if the system fails.
 
5. The alarm signal must be sent to a 24/7 monitor station that is supervised continuously by U.S. citizens who have been subjected to a trustworthiness determination according to DoD Manual 5200.02 Procedures for the DoD Personnel Security Program (PSP).
 
6. The monitor station must be capable of notifying security forces that can respond within 15 minutes.
 
7. PDS alarm functionality and performance must be verified on at least a weekly basis IAW Table 5 of the CNSSI 7003.
 
8. A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) must be available, which is approved by the facility security officer or security manager and commander/director, and the PDS approval authority.

The person selected to accomplish the technical system inspection is trained to recognize changes in the technical aspects of PDS, e.g., by-pass circuitry, attachment or removal of devices or components, inappropriate or suspicious signal levels, and mechanical, TEMPEST, and RED/BLACK integrity of the PDS. If conducted by the CTTA this meets the requirement; otherwise, sufficient documented proof of training must be provided for the person conducting the inspection.

1. The PDS must be inspected prior to initial operation.  Documentation of the inspection and results must be available for review.  This meets the following requirement from the CNSSI 7003: "The Approval Authority (AO) shall ensure PDS are inspected in accordance with SECTION XI and certified prior to initial operation."

2. The initial inspection must be a technical inspection performed by a trained CTTA prior to approval of the PDS by the AO.

3. The initial inspection must document the path of the PDS, the locations for all pull boxes, and the locations for all conduit joints at intervals less than the length of conduit segments (typically 10 feet).
 
NOTES:

1. The PDS may be documented using detailed "as-built" installation drawings or photographs. *Subsequent technical inspections can then verify the path of the PDS and the location of pull boxes and joints.

2. When test equipment is locally available and resident expertise allows, the initial inspection should measure and record the electrical characteristics of the PDS lines to obtain a baseline electrical profile of the PDS.
 
3. Such measurements may consist of signal levels, voltage levels, time domain reflectometer (TDR) recorded readings, and any other electrical measurements that may be recorded and retained. * Subsequent technical inspections may then record and compare measurements taken to the previously recorded baseline measurements to identify possible tampering attempts.

4. This check is applicable in a tactical environment if the PDS is located within a fixed facility.  It is not applicable to field/mobile PDS.
  
5. In the reviewer notes be sure to provide the date of the initial inspection, name of inspector and general description of results.

6. Obviously an initial inspection cannot ever be conducted once it is not completed.  Therefore the fix for this finding is to send a written request to the PDS approval authority asking for an "initial" inspection of the PDS by an individual appointed by the approval authority. If the approval authority concurs to conduct the inspection then this finding can be closed once the inspection is actually completed and any results form that inspection are closed.  If the reply from the approval authority indicates they will not complete their "required" inspection then then finding can be closed and the reply from the approval authority should be maintained for future reference.</fixtext><fix id="F-49129r769890_fix" /><check system="C-49174r769889_chk"><check-content-ref href="Traditional_Security_Checklist_None.xml" name="M" /><check-content>Check to ensure:

The key element to determine if this requirement is met is that any possible risk resulting from Emanations is properly considered and documented.

Failure to limit and control physical access to information visible on system monitor screens, information processing equipment containing classified data, removable storage media and printed documents is especially important in mixed US/FN environments.  Inadequate access and procedural controls can result in FN personnel having unauthorized access to classified materials and data, which can result in the loss or compromise of classified information, including NOFORN information. 
   
Appropriate but simple physical and procedural security measures must be put in place to ensure the FN partners do not have unauthorized access to information not approved for release to them. 

The primary control measure is to either keep US Only classified documents, information systems equipment and/ or associated removable storage media under continuous observation and control of a cleared US employee or place such items in an approved safe when unattended.

Additionally, escorting  visitors AND all FN employees/personnel into any area where there is US Only classified processing, documents, media, equipment or materials is not only a prudent security measure but an absolute requirement to prevent both intentional (insider threat) or unintentional (inadvertent) unauthorized exposure to classified materials and information.
 
Following are applicable excerpts from CJCSI 6510.01F pertaining to control of US Only workstation spaces (in particular SCIFs and secure rooms):

7. Information and Information System Access.  Access to DOD ISs is a revocable privilege and shall be granted to individuals based on need-to-know and IAW DODI 8500.2, NSTISSP No. 200, "National Policy on Controlled Access Protection" , Status of Forces Agreements for host national access, and DOD 5200.2-R, "Personnel Security System".
b. Individual foreign nationals may be granted access to specific classified U.S. networks and systems as specifically authorized under Information Sharing guidance outlined in changes to National Disclosure Policy (NDP-1).  
(1) Classified ISs shall be sanitized or configured to guarantee that foreign nationals have access only to classified information that has been authorized for disclosure to the foreign national's government or coalition, and is necessary to fulfill the terms of their assignments.
(2) U.S.-only classified workstations shall be under strict U.S. control at all times.
27. Foreign Access.
f. Foreign National Access to U.S.-Only Workstations and Network Equipment. CC/S/As shall:
(1) Maintain strict U.S. control of U.S.-only workstations and network equipment at all times.
(4) Announce presence. If a foreign national is permitted access to U.S.-controlled workstation space, the individual must be announced, must wear a badge clearly identifying him or her as a foreign national, and must be escorted at all times. In addition, a warning light must be activated if available and screens must be covered or blanked.

In a mixed US/FN partner environment the US personnel must know exactly what information can be shared and what cannot be shared or how to readily determine this information. For example the restrictions and cautions for partners from Belgium, Germany, France will be significantly greater relative to viewing anything on SIPRNet work stations versus the Australia, Canada, Great Britain partners. 

REQUIREMENT: There must be written local procedures and initial/recurring (at least annual) employee training to ensure familiarization with the rules for sharing classified and sensitive information with our partners. 

This topic must be included in the initial and annual site security awareness training.  

Any one of the following three items will result in a finding: 

1. Lack of written procedures, 
2. Lack of training, or 
3. Clear evidence employees are not familiar with the rules for information sharing.</fixtext><fix id="F-49154r769965_fix" /><check system="C-49199r769964_chk"><check-content-ref href="Traditional_Security_Checklist_None.xml" name="M" /><check-content>Check to ensure that US employees clearly understand the differences and limitations between REL Officers, other NATO partners, Non-NATO partners and Coalition Partners.

For example the restrictions and cautions for partners from Belgium, Germany, France will be significantly greater relative to viewing anything on SIPRNet work stations versus the Australia, Canada, Great Britain partners. This can only be done if there are written local procedures and initial/recurring (at least annual) employee training to ensure familiarization with the rules for sharing classified and sensitive information with our partners.  

It is recommended that employees sign an acknowledgement that they understand their responsibilities for sharing information, but this is not to be required.  

This particular check should be validated by specifically checking for written procedures and training records.  

This subject can be included in the initial and annual site security awareness training but must be clearly detailed as having been properly completed.  

The effectiveness of the program can be validated by conducting random employee interviews concerning their understanding of rules covering sharing classified and sensitive information with FN partners assigned to or visiting their organization/site.  

Any one of the following three items: Lack of written procedures, lack of training, or evidence employees are not familiar with the rules for information sharing will result in a finding.

2) The facility is "fixed facility" - a hard building made from normal construction materials - wood, steel, brick, stone, mortar, etc. 
3) Procedures for field/mobile elements are still required and should be available at a supporting headquarters, either in Theater or perhaps even CONUS.

An assessment of risk in accordance with the Risk Management Framework (RMF) along with Certification and Accreditation and an Authorization to Operate (ATO) must be  accomplished and documented prior to connecting NSA approved classified PED solutions on a classified network such as SIPRNet or using PEDs within a classified enclave.

A key requirement is that classified PEDs used to store classified data must comply with either the NSA Data At Rest (DAR) Capability Package and associated Risk Assessment or achieve NSA approval as a Tailored Solution for protection of data at rest.

Handling procedures should include guidance provided in NSA risk assessments and may involve two layers of National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP)-approved DAR protection, shipping/storage in accordance with Reference (a), and programmed data wiping or certificate revocation.

Two alternatives exist for check #1 in lieu of storage in a classified (secret or higher) vault, secure room or a SCIF:

a. Information Processing System (IPS) containers are safes designed to house operational Information Systems (IS) equipment and can be used to meet this requirement. The use of an IPS container is often a good recommendation when a deficiency is found.

b. A second alternative is to house network equipment in a 24/7 continuously occupied room or area. When using this method of control the equipment must be under the continuous (physical) observation and control of the cleared occupants. If using this alternative the network equipment must be maintained in lockable equipment storage cabinets. This is to ensure that only Network Administrators and other (authorized) personnel are the only persons with unimpeded access to the Network Connections. If the equipment is under continuous observation and control but not in a lockable cabinet or otherwise maintained to ensure that only Network Administrators and other(authorized) personnel have access, then it will be a CAT II finding under check #2 below. 

CHECK 2. Check also to ensure that only Network Administrators and other (authorized) personnel are the only persons with unimpeded access to the Network Connections, regardless if properly housed in a safe, vault or secure room (AKA: collateral classified open storage area). Lockable equipment storage cabinets may be used to meet this requirement (but only when the storage cabinets housing the network equipment is located within a vault, secure room or SCIF). (CAT II) 

CHECK 3.

802.1X authentication involves three parties: a supplicant, an authenticator, and an authentication server. The supplicant is a client device (such as a laptop) that wishes to attach to the LAN/WLAN. The term 'supplicant' is also used interchangeably to refer to the software running on the client that provides credentials to the authenticator. The authenticator is a network device, such as an Ethernet switch or wireless access point; and the authentication server is typically a host running software supporting the RADIUS and EAP protocols. In some cases, the authentication server software may be running on the authenticator hardware. 

The authenticator acts like a security guard to a protected network. The supplicant (i.e., client device) is not allowed access through the authenticator to the protected side of the network until the supplicant's identity has been validated and authorized. With 802.1X port-based authentication, the supplicant provides credentials, such as user name/password or digital certificate, to the authenticator, and the authenticator forwards the credentials to the authentication server for verification. If the authentication server determines the credentials are valid, the supplicant (client device) is allowed to access resources located on the protected side of the network.

The requirements in this Traditional Security STIG rule serve as physical security mitigations for the lack of proper SIPRNet port security using IEEE 802.1X.  It is in essence a supplement to the Network STIG and provides the details for required mitigations. 

Network connections that are not properly protected are highly vulnerable to unauthorized access, resulting in the loss or compromise of classified or sensitive information.

2. SIPRNet connected Wall Jacks must be under the continuous observation of a cleared individual.

DETAILED EXPLANATION FOLLOWS:

1. The primary and most basic requirement (IAW the Network Policy found in the Layer 2 Switch STIG - Cisco) is implementation of IEEE port authentication standard 802.1X (logical software based port security) - regardless of the physical area or space in which the wall jacks/ports are located. TRADITIONAL SECURITY REVIEWERS MUST FIRST CHECK WITH THE NETWORK REVIEWER to determine if 802.1X has been properly implemented on SIPRNet before evaluating the physical security of SIPRNet Wall Jacks. * Do this early in your site visit so that wall jack physical security considerations can be properly evaluated during your site tour/walk around.

2. Not using 802.1X based port authentication on SIPRNet is a CAT I *Network STIG" finding, separate from any traditional security considerations. However, if 802.1X is not implemented there is another software based alternative, which is the Network STIG requirement to allow for "legacy" port security via MAC address. Several caveats go with this alternative and this is when the physical security mitigations are required to be implemented:  

    a. Use of simple MAC port security rather than 802.1X will result in a CAT III (*Network STIG) finding (on NIPRNet or SIPRNet). While this is not a traditional security check, it is something to be aware of.

    b. If simple MAC port security rather than 802.1X is implemented *on SIPRNet* (OR IF THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO LOGICAL SOFTWARE BASED PORT SECURITY), the traditional security considerations and mitigations required IAW the Access Control STIG are as follows:  

       (1) If the wall jacks/drops/ports are located within spaces properly established as Secret or TS vaults or Secret or TS Secure Rooms (AKA: Collateral Classified Open Storage Areas) OR within an approved SCIF, then there is no requirement for supplemental physical security measures.  Again - No supplemental physical security controls are required for SIPRNet wall jacks in these areas.  

     (2) If the wall jacks are not located in Secret or higher secure room/vault/SCIF, the following physical security controls must be in place:

          (a) SIPRNet wall jacks must be secured *when not attended by persons with Secret or higher clearance* by a properly constructed lock box (Hoffman or similar commercial product or locally fabricated). The lock box must be 18-gauge steel or better and have no exposed or removable hinges (internal hinges are ideal). If used, external hinge pins must be peened, welded, etc. so they cannot be removed without evidence of forced removal. Hasp hardware must be riveted to the box or otherwise installed so that removal will require physical breaking of the box or hasp, thereby leaving evidence of actual or attempted entry. No pre-punch (knock-out) holes are allowed in the box. The lock box must be secured with a 3-position high security combination padlock (IAW the NSTISSI 7003 standard for PDS "Pull Boxes"). The S&amp;G 8077 combination padlock is the ONLY existing combo padlock meeting this standard. See the DoD Lock Program site for details: 

https://portal.navfac.navy.mil/portal/page/portal/navfac/navfac_ww_pp/navfac_nfesc_pp/locks/CM_LOCKS/CL_PADLOCK/TAB_PADLOCK_PROD

          (b) If lock boxes are not used the alternative is to physically disconnect the hot SIPRNet transmission lines at the SIPRNet Point of Presence (PoP) after normal duty hours. The PoP must be located within a proper Secret or higher secure room or vault or SCIF.

NOTE 1: To reiterate the basic requirement: If IEEE 802.1X is properly implemented at the switch to authenticate devices *with clients (such as user work stations)* no additional supplemental physical security controls are required for the wall jacks. VERIFICATION FOR 802.1X IMPLEMENTATION MUST BE COORDINATED WITH THE NETWORK REVIEWER.

NOTE 2: Regardless of Port Authentication using IEEE 802.1X, *clientless devices (such as printers, scanners or multi-functional devices (MFD)* cannot be authenticated - but this should not cause an issue with needing supplemental physical controls (lock box or disconnect at PoP). The reason is because clientless devices like these that are connected to SIPRNet should "normally" be maintained in a Secret/TS secure room or vault or SCIF and therefore would not require supplemental physical security of the wall jacks.  Otherwise, MFD wall jacks must be protected by lock boxes or physical disconnect at the PoP after normal duty hours. Additional physical security measures or procedures for protection of classified MFD hard drives, residual images and printed materials will also be required, but these considerations are addressed elsewhere on the checklist. 

NOTE 3: Do not confuse the STIG wall jack lock box requirement with the CNSSI 7003 lock box requirement on the physical end point (Termination Boxes) of a Protected Distribution System (PDS). The reference for PDS is the CNSSI 7003, not the Access Control STIG. The requirements for PDS (pull-boxes, Access Points or Termination Boxes) and wall jack (lock boxes) are totally separate and unique, although it is possible to find the end of a PDS terminating in a lock box - that ALSO fulfills the requirement for protection of a wall jack where 802.1X is not implemented.  

NOTE 4: If there is no "legacy" MAC port security in place  there will be a CAT I port security finding written by the Network reviewer. If the traditional security reviewer also finds a CAT I finding for lack of physical security protective measures there is a CCRI scoring over ride that will decrease the OVERALL CCRI score. So where there is absolutely no logical or physical port/wall jack security in place - the result is very severe in terms of the CCRI score. Traditional Security reviewers, Network Reviewers (and Team Leads) need to be aware of this because of its significance to the site being reviewed.

Written procedures must be developed that cover the requirements and process for Visit Authorization Letters (VAL) for contractors visiting and/or employed at government sites. 

2. All government sites must have a VAL on file for each contractor visiting the site temporarily and also for permanent party contractors routinely working/physically employed at the site.  

NOTES: 

JPAS should be used for most short term "visitor" VALs; however, in addition to JPAS (or as an alternative to JPAS for contractors who do not have JPAS accounts) VALs may also be passed via hard copy or electronically using email (mail, fax, email) for "assigned" contractor employees.  This is because JPAS is by design intended for short term visits; whereas, contractor  "employee" VALs require additional information (such as contract number, COR identification, etc.) that cannot be input or passed via JPAS.  

A hard copy VAL for assigned contractor employees will help to eliminate substantive confusion over the company Facility Clearance Level (FCL), individual contract employee security clearance levels, IT position assignments based on job descriptions (found in applicable Statements of Work (SOW and/or DD 254), etc.   </fixtext><fix id="F-49178r770037_fix" /><check system="C-49223r770036_chk"><check-content-ref href="Traditional_Security_Checklist_None.xml" name="M" /><check-content>1. Check with the security manager or personnel security specialists to ensure there are written procedures for  contractors visiting government sites. 

2. Ask to see copies of the site VALs and/or determine site VAL process based on the processing of contractors on your inspection team.  

3. Ensure all government facilities have a VAL on file for all contractors visiting the site - to include permanent party contractors.  

NOTES: 

1. JPAS should and will likely be used for most short term "visitor" VALs; however, in addition to JPAS the VAL may also be passed via hard copy or electronically using email (mail, fax, email) for "assigned" contractor employees. This is because JPAS is by design intended for short term visits; whereas, contractor "employee" VALs should require additional information (such as contract number, COR identification, etc.) that cannot be input or passed via JPAS. Lack of a hard copy VAL alone for assigned contractor employees at a site will not necessarily be cause for a finding if a VAL in JPAS is available.  Reviewers must use discretion when evaluating if the lack of hard copy VAL has caused any substantive confusion over the company Facility Clearance Level (FCL), individual contract employee security clearance levels, IT position assignments based on job descriptions (found in applicable Statements of Work (SOW and/or DD 254), etc. when deciding if a finding is warranted. For instance an individual employee's JPAS access might indicate they have TS clearance - but the FCL for the company is only at the Secret level and/or the contract only allows for up to Secret access.  If the site is allowing access to TS for this individual - then the lack of a hard copy VAL could be cited as a finding, in addition to any other related findings for this discovery.

2. Applies in a tactical environment if contract personnel visit or are assigned.

3. Reviewers should be sure to note in the findings report if the finding concerns JPAS issues for short term contractor visitors or if it concerns "hard copy" VALs for assigned contractor employees.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-245793"><title>ID-03.02.01</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-245793r770041_rule" weight="10.0" severity="medium"><version>ID-03.02.01</version><title>Industrial Security - Contract Guard Vetting

3. Ensure forms SF 700, Security Container Information are properly completed for each safe, vault and secure room used to store classified DISN assets. The SF 700 is a two-part form consisting of an envelope with a tear-off tab and cover sheet. The cover sheet and face of the envelope (Part 1 of the form) provide space for information about the activity, container, type of lock, and who to contact if the container is left open. Required checks follow. Ensure the SF 700: 

  a. Shows the location of the door or container.

  b. Reflects the names, home addresses, and home telephone numbers of the individuals having knowledge of the combination who are to be contacted in the event that the vault, secure room, or container is found open and unattended.

  c. Part 1 of SF 700 is not classified, but contains personally identifiable information (PII) that shall be protected by sealing Part 1 in an opaque envelope (not provided as part of the SF 700) conspicuously marked "Security Container Information" and stored in accordance with SF 700 instructions. NOTE: If the information must be accessed during non-duty hours and a new opaque envelope is not available to replace the opened one, the original envelope should be temporarily resealed, to the extent possible, until Part 1 can be placed in a new envelope the next working day.

  d. After the cover sheet (Part 1) is filled out and sealed in an opaque envelope, attach it to the inside of the control drawer or on the inside face of the vault or secure room door, with either tape or a magnetically-attached holder.

  e. The tear-off tab (Part 2) with the combination record is placed in the envelope provided with the form, sealed, properly marked with the classification level and stored by the security manager in another approved classified container.

4. Ensure forms SF 702, Security Container Check Sheet are properly completed for each safe, vault and secure room used to store classified DISN assets. Following are required checks for the SF 702 form. Ensure:
 
  a. It provides a record of the names and times that persons have opened, closed or checked a particular container (safe, vault or secure room) that holds classified information.

  b. It is properly annotated to reflect each opening and closing of the container.

  c. It is properly annotated to reflect (at least) daily checks of ALL containers - whenever an area housing the containers is entered/occupied - EVEN IF THE CONTAINER IS NOT OPENED. If on weekends or holidays the area housing the container is not occupied the SF 702 would not require annotation; however, in the event the area is accessed for even a short period of time, the SF 702 forms for each container in the area should be annotated to reflect the container was checked. Annotation of the SF 702 forms should be conducted IN ADDITION TO the annotation of SF 701 forms reflecting end-of-day checks.

NOTE: If CC/S/A INFOSEC implementing instructions contain specific guidance in contradiction to the above DoDIN SF 702 requirements/checks then the CC/S/A guidance may be followed. Failure to comply with either the above guidance or CC/S/A documented guidance will result in a finding of non-compliance.

5. Ensure container repairs are conducted correctly IAW FED-STD-809. Details are at the DoD Lock Program WEB Portal for Drawer head Replacement.

TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT: This check is applicable where safes, vaults or secure rooms are used to protect classified materials or systems. The only exception will be for urgent (short term) tactical operations or other contingency situations where fixed facilities and equipment are not yet present or incapable of being used.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-245795"><title>IS-02.01.01</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-245795r822845_rule" weight="10.0" severity="high"><version>IS-02.01.01</version><title>Information Security (INFOSEC) - Vault/Secure Room Storage Standards - Door Combination Lock  Meeting Federal Specification FF-L-2740</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Failure to meet Physical Security storage standards could result in the undetected loss or compromise of classified material.

Using a physical intrusion detection system enables immediate detection of attempted and/or actual intrusion into a secure room space.  This is often the best supplemental protective measure (vice using 4-hour random checks) due to providing capability for immediate detection, and for immediate response to assess and counter the threat to the secure room space.  Use of 4-hour checks may be adequate if supported by a risk assessment, but will not provide the immediate detection and response capability of a properly installed IDS.  It is required that a risk assessment be conducted to determine which of these two intrusion detection methods (use of IDS OR 4-hour random checks) is appropriate for any particular location.

3. Security-in-Depth for each secure room must be approved *in writing* by the CC/S/A senior agency official (senior official for security)

Except for storage in a GSA-approved container (AKA: safe) or a vault built to FED STD 832, one of the following supplemental controls is required for secure rooms or areas containing SIPRNet (secret) assets, provided the CC/S/A senior agency official determines in writing that security-in-depth exists:
 
(1) Inspection of the container or open storage area every four hours by an employee cleared at least to the Secret level; or 
(2) An IDS with the personnel responding to the alarm arriving within 30 minutes of the alarm annunciation.

IMPORTANT NOTE:  Random checks not exceeding 4-hours are an allowable alternative to IDS ONLY if supported by a valid risk assessment.  

Prior to the installation of an IDS, the site shall perform a risk analysis to determine the threat, vulnerabilities, security-in-depth countermeasures,  the acceptability of risk, potential cost savings, procedural requirements, and potential cost of additional manpower associated with random checks of the secure room as an alternative to IDS.  

Random checks and risk analysis are each covered as separate checks elsewhere in this checklist.  

This particular check for IDS is Not Applicable (NA) if random checks are properly conducted and are supported by the risk analysis and security-in-depth approved by the senior agency official in writing.

In summary this check is to validate an IDS is being used AND that it is supported by a valid risk assessment AND  security-in-depth approved by the senior agency official in writing. 
 
Checks: 

1. Check to ensure that all secure rooms/classified open storage areas that afford access to classified SIPRNet equipment (servers, routers, switches, comm equipment, work stations, DASD, etc...) are protected by an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) *unless continually occupied. (CAT I)

2. Where IDS is being used check to ensure that its use is supported by both a RISK ASSESSMENT and a SECURITY-IN-DEPTH DETERMINATION * (Security-In-Depth Determination must IN WRITING by the C/S/A senior agency (security) official) that specifically addresses the secure room or open storage space. (CAT II) 

TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT:  This check is applicable where Secure Rooms are used to protect classified materials or systems in a tactical environment. The only exception will be for urgent (short term) tactical operations or other contingency situations where fixed facilities and equipment are not yet present or incapable of being used.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-245802"><title>IS-02.01.08</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-245802r822854_rule" weight="10.0" severity="high"><version>IS-02.01.08</version><title>Information Security (INFOSEC) - Secure Room Storage Standards - Balanced Magnetic Switch (BMS) on Perimeter Doors</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Failure to meet standards for ensuring that there is structural integrity of the physical perimeter surrounding a secure room (AKA: collateral classified open storage area) IAW DoD Manual 5200.01, Volume 3 could result in the undetected loss or compromise of classified material.  When a physical Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is used as the supplemental protection measure (in lieu of 4-hour random checks) for secure rooms there is a requirement to place a Balanced Magnetic Switch (BMS) alarm contact on the primary ingress/egress door and any secondary/emergency exit doors.  This alarm sensor is an essential part of any properly installed IDS and ensures that doors opened by force or that are left open are immediately detected.  A BMS (AKA: triple biased alarm contact) is the most difficult door alarm contact to defeat and must be used in lieu of dual biased or simple alarm contacts.

Motion detection located interior to secure rooms provides the most complete/overarching coverage of any Intrusion Detection System (IDS) alarm sensor.  While most sensors like BMS alarm contacts, glass break detectors, etc. are only able to detect potential intrusion at specific locations, use of motion detection provides a capability to protect large areas with "blanket coverage" generally using fewer sensors.

Principles and considerations for "ideal" employment of motion sensors are:

- Consolidate critical assets in specific areas versus throughout a large room or facility. For instance rather than having classified servers and equipment in multiple locations in a five-story facility (entirely designated for classified open storage) consolidate classified assets on a single floor or even an area on that floor. That might allow for reducing the space designated as classified open storage (AKA: secure room) and reduce costs and simplify protection of assets.  

- Conversely some would argue that dispersing assets over a larger area enhances security by not putting all critical assets in one place. This is true to an extent - especially if we are considering redundant assets for COOP / disaster recovery but most often the reason for dispersing classified assets over large comes down to lack of foresight and planning.

- Cover avenues of approach in layers so you can detect initial breeches of secured space and subsequent movement within. This approach is actually very good if you have a timely response force available and you are protecting a large facility.

- Cover perimeter access points such as doors, windows, and openings greater than 96 sq. inches. Use of point sensors (BMS, vibration, etc., are probably best in these situations but supplementation by motion can be extremely effective.

- Cover areas that cannot be directly observed by employees from within or directly outside the protected space. For instance in a secure room/area this might include areas above suspended ceilings, below raised floors, behind major pieces of equipment or other things that cause significant obstruction of visual observation (especially along avenues of approach or along perimeter walls).

- Cover large open areas by careful placement of motion detection. Combinations of 360-degree and wall-mounted detectors considering equipment racks, walls, avenues of approach, etc. can effectively cover larger areas with fewer sensors.

- Complete coverage of large areas and all avenues of approach is ideal but often funds are limited and sensors cannot be employed to provide blanket coverage. In such instances there are two approaches that can be used:

   * One is to cover the most critical assets directly (e.g., classified DoDIN servers, routers, DASD and other major IT technology).

   * Second approach is to conduct an assessment of the space to determine the most effective employment of limited sensors considering both avenues of approach and the actual location of critical assets in the space.   

NOTE:  The second approach can be incorporated under the process of conducting a risk assessment and in conjunction with a determination and approval of security-in-depth countermeasures from the Senior Agency Official (SAO). This risk-based approach is based directly on requirements from the DoD Manual 5200.01, V3 and is in line with the current direction DoD is taking with regard to management of risk.

Secure rooms or areas where classified SIPRNet equipment and/or associated media is stored in the open must be protected with interior motion detection sensors; e.g., ultrasonic and passive infrared when the specific area containing the classified material is closed or not under continuous observation and control of a cleared employee.  

Use of dual technology is authorized when one technology transmits an alarm condition independently from the other technology. A failed detector shall cause an immediate and continuous alarm condition.

Employment of motion detectors need not cover 100% of the entire secure room space (although that is recommended) but shall minimally (directly) cover any SIPRNet assets (equipment or media) that are accessible (not stored within a GSA approved container (safe)) within the secure room or area.  

2. At a minimum all SIPRNet connected equipment must be directly covered by motion sensors OR  motion sensors must be employed in the secure room space as "specifically detailed" in the risk assessment, which is approved by the Component Authorizing Official (AO).

Unless adequately detailed in the risk assessment, motion detectors placed to cover only doors that are protected with BMS alarm contacts are not sufficient to meet this requirement/check.

2. Where a proper risk assessment signed by the AO, which specifically considers both the number and employment (positioning) of motion sensors in the secure room space and a supporting Security-in-Depth Determination signed by the SAO are both available:

Check that motion sensors are either employed to directly cover all areas within the secure room containing SIPRNet assets OR that motion sensors are employed in the secure room space as specifically detailed in the risk assessment.

Using a physical intrusion detection system enables immediate detection of attempted and/or actual intrusion into a secure room space.  This is often the best supplemental protective measure (vice using 4-hour random checks) due to providing capability for immediate detection, and for immediate response to assess and counter the threat to the secure room space.  Use of 4-hour checks may be adequate if supported by a risk assessment, but will not provide the immediate detection and response capability of a properly installed IDS.  It is required that a risk assessment be conducted to determine which of the two intrusion detection methods (use of IDS OR 4-hour random checks) is appropriate for any particular location.  If the risk assessment results in a determination that use of 4-hour random checks is the most cost efficient supplemental control (vice IDS) to protect SIPRNet assets contained in secure rooms, the manner in which the checks are conducted can greatly impact the effectiveness of the checks.  Thorough physical checks conducted on a frequent basis can reduce the time between an attempted or actual intrusion and time of discovery - during random checks.

This requirement is concerned with using random checks as the required supplemental control of secure room/collateral classified open storage area space (containing SIPRNet assets) - instead of IDS.  

Fixes:

1. Use of random checks in lieu of IDS must be supported by a valid risk assessment (addressing each secure room or area) that specifically considers the threat, vulnerabilities, security-in-depth countermeasures, acceptability of risk, potential cost savings, procedural requirements, and potential cost of additional manpower associated with random checks of the secure areas - as an alternative to IDS.  

2. The frequency of random checks must not exceed 4-hours when the secure area space is not attended. 

3. Checks must be conducted by guards/employees who are cleared to at least the Secret level.  

4. Checks must be conducted of each door (primary and all secondary), each window, and each opening exceeding 96 square inches (which are required to be protected with either bars, expanded metal grills, commercial metal sounds baffles) to ensure they are properly secured.  Additionally all traversable space surrounding the exterior of the Secure Room must be viewed by the checker by walking around the entire perimeter.  

5.  Checks must be supported by written procedures/instructions for the checkers and results of checks must be recorded.  

6. Locally developed checklists or the Standard Form (SF) 701 must be used to document checks.  Completed checklists should be maintained on-hand for at least 90-days as an audit trail or indefinitely if discrepancies were noted during any checks.

Ultimately this could result in the undetected loss or compromise of classified material.

USE CASE EXPLANATION:

A Continuous Operations Facility functions 24/7 and contains classified SIPRNet equipment and/or media.  It often does not meet all the physical and/or procedural requirements of a vault or secure room (AKA: collateral classified open storage area) and the classified equipment and/or media may not be stored in an approved safe when not in use.  Examples of such facilities are Emergency Operations Centers (EOC), Information System Monitoring Centers, Trouble Desk Centers, etc.  All standards for access control monitoring for Continuous Operations Facilities are found in the DoD Manual 5200.01, V3 and this STIG Requirement/Rule provides additional clarification and implementation standards for all Continuous Operations Facilities containing SIPRNet assets.

Continuous Operations Facilities are not routinely closed and secured after normal business hours and reopened at the beginning of normal workdays.   A CONTINUOUS OPERATIONS FACILITY MUST BE CONTINUOUSLY OCCUPIED at all times, OR IT MUST MEET ALL PHYSICAL STRUCTURAL AND PROCEDURAL STANDARDS FOR A SECURE ROOM AND BE SECURED (*using an approved FF-L-2740 combination lock) DURING PERIODS WHEN IT IS NOT OCCUPIED.  It is not necessary to activate the supplemental controls (IDS or 4-hour checks) when securing the facility using the FF-L-2740 lock during working hours. However, this must be done if the facility is formally closed at any time and will include End-of-Day (EOD) checks.   A "facility" can be a single room or a larger contiguous area, often (but not always) without Federal Specification FF-L-2740 combination locks on the primary access door.  Continuous Operations area access control procedures must meet the requirements herein even where the surrounding area is continuously occupied.  Continuous Operations (again - continuous occupancy)  minimizes or eliminates the need for/use of certain security measures such as FF-L-2740 combination locks, standard door locks, IDS, 4-hour guard checks, etc.

Where there is a Continuous Operations Facility there should be demonstrated mission need for continuous occupation of the "specific" room or area containing the classified SIPRNet assets.  A justification that the surrounding building or facility is continuously occupied is not acceptable.  If this is observed, reviewers should consider the possibility that the stated requirement for a Continuous Operations Facility is being used to cover deficiencies with what should legitimately be established as a secure room or vault.  In such cases the use of Traditional Security STIG Requirements and applicable physical and procedural standards for vaults and/or secure rooms may be more appropriate, resulting in findings under those Requirements.

A Continuous Operations Facility containing classified materials is most appropriate when it is continuously occupied by properly cleared employees (or others with security clearance and a need-to-know) who are capable of controlling or monitoring ingress and egress from within the area.  This provides the most legitimate justification for using a Continuous Operations Facility vice using a properly constructed and access controlled vault or secure room (AKA: collateral classified open storage area).  Convenience and ease of access is not proper justification for a Continuous Operations Facility.

Continuous Operations Facility door control may be accomplished multiple ways.  There are five main types of access control methods listed below.  One or more of the five methods may apply to any facility.  Each access point must comply with one or more of the methods of access control for 24 hours of each operational day.  Any deficiency for any facility access point (even for a portion of the day for an access point) will result in a finding under this STIG rule.  All Continuous Operations Facilities access points should be checked for proper access control according to the type of access control method(s) implemented.

Direct access control monitoring for both occupied and unoccupied Continuous Operations Facilities is conducted by:  cleared employees, guards or receptionists located inside the area or directly outside the area.  A properly configured Automated Entry Control System (AECS) or continuously monitored Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) are the only options for indirect monitoring of Continuous Operations Facilities.

The five basic methods for controlling access to Continuous Operations Facilities are:

1.  Method #1: Use of an Automated Entry Control System (AECS) Card Reader with Biometrics or Personal Identification Number (PIN)

2.  Method #2:  Access Continually Monitored by Occupants (Cleared Employees) of the Continuous Operations Facility - all doors NOT visible

3.  Method #3:  Access Monitored by Occupants (Cleared Employees) of the Continuous Operations Facility - all doors are visible

4.  Method #4:  Access Monitored by Employees Directly Outside the Open Storage Space - all doors MUST BE visible

5.  Method #5:  Access Monitored by Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) reporting to a Central Monitoring Station Staffed 24/7 by cleared Guards or Other cleared Security Professionals - each individual door MUST HAVE a CCTV camera(s)

Normally only one method of access control will be applicable to a specific Continuous Operations Facility; however, there may be situations where more than one approved method is being used at a single facility.  For instance an Automated Entry Control System (AECS) with card reader and PIN may be used to secure the access door while there are also employees located inside the room who can monitor and control access.  In situations where multiple methods are found, reviewers need only choose one of the five to evaluate compliance and its effectiveness of access control to the Continuous Operations Facility.  If one of the methods is found to be totally compliant while others in use contain deficiencies, the method that is 100% compliant should be selected for use during the review.  In the example just provided, if the room is only occupied by one employee who is monitoring access and during breaks or for other reasons exits the room for periods of time this would cause a significant deficient condition since the access door is not continuously monitored by the employee.  Therefore using the AECS as the method to evaluate access control for the Continuous Operations Facility would likely be selected since it appears to be (and for this example we will assume) 100% compliant.

There is also a possibility that multiple Continuous Operations Facilities could be found at a particular site location (even in the same building) that are using different methods to control access.  Once again, multiple methods of access control from the list of five could be selected for the evaluation, based on the access control methods actually being used for the various 24/7Continuous Operations Facilities.

Once the applicable Continuous Operations Facility access control methods that apply to each of the Continuous Operations Facilities at the site are selected, the site must comply with all of the individual checks for the selected method(s).  Specific checks for requirements associated with a method of access control are found in the Check Content information field.

If there is no Continuous Operations Facility at a particular site this Requirement is Not Applicable (NA) for a review.

1.  All possible primary or secondary entrances to vaults or secure rooms must be continuously monitored by cleared employees or guards (inside or outside the room or area) or by CCTV, whenever the FF-L-2740 combination lock is disengaged for daytime or other routine access.     

2.  If CCTV is used it must send real time images to a continuously manned monitoring station.  

3. Access to a continuously (visually) monitored vault, secure room or collateral classified open storage area must be controlled by an Automated Entry Control System (AECS) using coded cards or badges (biometrics or PIN are not required) or by electric, mechanical or electro-mechanical access control devices to limit access during duty hours. 

**If use of an Automated Entry Control System (AECS) is used to control access (without use of any authorized visual control methods), use the following seven fixes to comply with requirements:

1.  The vault, secure room or area must be continuously occupied by at least one properly cleared employee during working hours (when the FF-L-2740 combination lock is not engaged).

2. The AECS must identify individuals and authenticate the person's authority to enter the area through the use of a coded identification (ID) badge or card. 

3. In addition to the swipe or proximity card or badge a personal identification number (PIN) must be used.  This is required WHEN VISUAL (MONITORING) CONTROLS of the entrance ARE NOT USED during working hours.  

4. The PINs must be separately entered into the system by each individual using a keypad device and consist of four or more digits, randomly selected, with no known or logical association with the individuals.
  
5. There must be a procedure in place to cover changing PINs when it is believed they have been compromised or subjected to compromise.  

6. Biometrics Devices, which identify an individual requesting access by some unique personal characteristic, such as Fingerprinting, Hand Geometry, Handwriting, Retina scans, or Voice recognition may be used in conjunction with an ID badge or card in lieu of a PIN.  

7.  VERY IMPORTANT: Electric, mechanical or electro-mechanical access control devices such as Cipher locks MUST NOT BE USED to control access to secure rooms or areas that are not under continuous visual control during working hours.  Generally these locks do not provide the means for individual access codes and do not report to a central server or system monitor.  Therefore they are permissible ONLY for access control to secure rooms and spaces when the entrance is under continuous visual control.  
</fixtext><fix id="F-49194r770085_fix" /><check system="C-49239r822861_chk"><check-content-ref href="Traditional_Security_Checklist_None.xml" name="M" /><check-content>Background Information and Requirements Summary: 

1.  The FF-L-2740 combination lock securing the primary access door for vaults and secure rooms (AKA: collateral classified open storage areas) may be opened at the beginning of normal duty hours and left unlocked for frequent employee access only if the entrance is properly monitored and controlled.  The combination lock will be secured at the end of normal duty hours and interior motion alarms (if used) activated.  

2.  Entrances to vaults, secure rooms or collateral classified open storage areas must be under visual control at all times during duty hours to prevent entry by unauthorized personnel.

3.  An automated access control system (AECS) may be used to monitor and control admittance during working hours instead of visual control, if it consists of a swipe or proximity coded card and reader, supplemented by the use of a Personal Identification Number (PIN) or by use of Biometric readers (fingerprints, retina scanner, etc.).   Additionally, the secure room or classified storage area must be occupied by cleared employees OR under direct visual control from just outside the room or area.  Use of an Automated Entry Control System (AECS) alone may not be used to meet this standard.  Use of an AECS to control and monitor access requires the room or area be occupied by at least one properly cleared person.

4.  Visual monitoring or control of secure room access points may be accomplished by several methods (e.g., employee work station, guard, "continuously monitored" CCTV).  Employee monitoring may be conducted by cleared employees within the secure room space, who can observe all entrances or employees located just outside the secure room adjacent to an entrance may also "actively" monitor access. If CCTV is used to monitor, the CCTV cameras must cover all potential entrances and send real time images back to a continuously manned monitoring station.

5.  Regardless of the visual method used to monitor daytime access, a locking system for access control must still be used on the entrance to the secure area.  The use of automated entry control systems,(AECS with coded ID cards or badges) is encouraged.  Supplementing the coded (swipe or proximity) cards or badges with a PIN or biometrics is not required if the entrances are properly monitored by visual means.  

6.  Access to secure areas may also be controlled by electric, mechanical or electro-mechanical access control devices to limit access during duty hours, but only if the entrance is also under continuous visual control. 

7.  IMPORTANT NOTE: Electrically actuated locks (e.g., cypher, proximity card and magnetic strip card locks) do not afford by themselves the required degree of protection for classified information and must not be used as a substitute for the combination locks meeting Federal Specification FF-L-2740. 

CHECKS:

*If f visual control methods are the primary means to monitor and control access during duty hours, use the following three checks to evaluate:
 
Check #1.  Check to ensure that all possible primary or secondary entrances to vaults or secure rooms are continuously monitored by cleared employees or guards (inside or outside the room or area) or by CCTV, whenever the FF-L-2740 combination lock is disengaged for daytime or other routine access.     (CAT I)

Check #2.  Check to ensure that if CCTV is used it sends real time images to a continuously manned monitoring station.  (CAT I)

Check #3.  If CCTV is used to visually monitor the secure room or area and / or guards or other personnel are not physically controlling access: Check to ensure that access to a continuously (visually) monitored vault, secure room or collateral classified open storage area is controlled either by an Automated Entry Control System (AECS) using coded cards or badges (biometrics or PIN are not required) or by electric, mechanical or electro-mechanical access control devices to limit access during duty hours.  (CAT I)

NOTE: Electric, mechanical or electro-mechanical access control devices may not be used to control access when the entrance(s) to the vault, secure room or area are not under continuous visual monitoring either directly by cleared employees at the entrance(s) or via CCTV.  If using CCTV it must also be continuously monitored and recorded at an occupied monitoring station.

**If an Automated Entry Control System (AECS) is used to control access (without use of any authorized visual control methods), use the following seven checks to evaluate:

CHECKS:

Check #1. Check to ensure the vault, secure room or area is continuously occupied by at least one properly cleared employee during working hours (when the FF-L-2740 combination lock is not engaged. (CAT I)

Check #2. Check to ensure the AECS identifies individuals and authenticates the person's authority to enter the area through the use of a coded identification (ID) badge or card. (CAT I)

Check #3. Check to ensure that in addition to the swipe or proximity card or badge - that a personal identification number (PIN) is used.  This is required WHEN VISUAL (MONITORING) of the entrance IS NOT USED during working hours. (CAT II - when an AECS card and reader is used w/o PIN or biometrics) 

Check #4. Check the PINs are separately entered into the system by each individual using a keypad device and consist of four or more digits, randomly selected, with no known or logical association with the individuals. (CAT II -only  when an AECS with card and PIN is used) 

Check #5. Check to ensure there is a procedure to cover changing PINs when it is believed they have been compromised or subjected to compromise. (CAT III) 

Check #6. Biometrics Devices, which identify an individual requesting access by some unique personal characteristic, such as Fingerprinting, Hand Geometry, Handwriting, Retina scans, or Voice recognition may be used in conjunction with an ID badge or card in lieu of a PIN.  (CAT II - when an AECS card and reader is used w/o PIN or biometrics)

Check #7.  VERY IMPORTANT: Check to ensure that electric, mechanical or electro-mechanical access control devices such as Cipher locks ARE NOT USED to control access to vaults, secure rooms or areas when entrances  are not under continuous visual control during working hours.  Generally these locks do not provide the means for individual access codes and do not report to a central server or system monitor.  Therefore they are permissible ONLY for access control to vault, secure rooms and spaces when the entrance is under continuous visual control.  (CAT I)

TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT:  These checks are applicable where Vaults/Secure Rooms are used to protect classified materials or systems in a tactical environment.

This fix is concerned with ensuring there is periodic visual validation of structural integrity of secure room/collateral classified open storage area perimeters containing SIPRNet assets and associated media.  It ensures that any breach or attempted breach of the walls, true floors and true ceilings of a secure area (which are not readily visible) are discovered in a timely manner.

In requirement #1 there are 3 different situations covered and each requires a different level of physical/visual validation for structural integrity. 
 
Requirement #1. Structural integrity of secure rooms or spaces containing SIPRNet equipment must be validated in each situation as follows: 
 
Situation #1 (No structural integrity checks required): If interior IDS (motion detection) is *properly employed (*directly covering all SIPRNet assets) within the secure room or collateral classified open storage space where classified SIPRNet assets are located AND under raised floor spaces (if applicable) AND above suspended ceiling spaces (if applicable), then no physical check for structural integrity is required.  This is contingent upon the interior motion sensors being activated when the room is closed or unattended, and that the sensors work properly as determined by required checks of sensor functionality.
  
Situation #2 (Monthly checks required): If motion sensors are properly employed ONLY within the secure room space where classified assets are located, then a visual check of spaces below raised floor, above suspended ceilings and anywhere else the perimeter of the secure area cannot be readily observed must be conducted on at least a monthly basis.  The goal is to visually inspect all walls, true floor and true ceiling perimeters for signs of breach or attempted breach.
   
Situation #3 (Weekly checks required): When random checks (not exceeding 4-hours) of secure rooms or open storage spaces are used in lieu of IDS then the checks specified in situation #2 for above suspended ceilings and below raised floors must be conducted at least weekly.  The increased frequency of checks is due to the significant vulnerability of the SIPRNet assets to undetected attack from portions of the perimeter that cannot be readily observed.  NOTE: Physical inspection of the perimeter walls, floor and ceiling can be greatly expedited and may be conducted without ladders or other equipment where there are no false/suspended ceilings and/or raised floors within or surrounding the secure room or area.
   
NOTE: If the entire perimeter of the secure room or area is surrounded by a secret or top secret (TS) Controlled Access Area (CAA) the frequency of structural integrity checks may be reduced to once every two weeks. This is due to the increased security-in-depth provided by the CAA. A secret or TS CAA is an area where unescorted access is granted only to those individuals who have a secret or higher security clearance. All others are escorted by cleared employees. The DoD does not provide specific physical security requirements for a CAA but allows each CC/S/A Senior Agency Official (SAO) for Information Security the authority to establish such standards. All the Services have established standards for CAAs within their Protected Distribution System (PDS) implementing guidelines. Minimally all require some form of access control methodology (AECS/guards/reception...) be in place to ensure only properly vetted and cleared personnel have unescorted access to a CAA.

Requirement #2. There must be written procedures developed for the checks and that the checks are documented and maintained on file for a minimum of 90 days.  Where discrepancies (holes in perimeter or other signs of successful or attempted access) are noted these checks will be maintained indefinitely or until an inquiry determines the cause of the discrepancy.

In spite of all physical security defensive devices deployed, the possibility of an intrusion always exists. The highest fence can be scaled, the densest wall can be breached and the stoutest lock can be compromised.  Even highly sophisticated alarm systems can be contravened by a knowledgeable professional.  It is therefore necessary to institute a system of checks to physically inspect secure room perimeters to check for signs of attempted intrusions and ensure that structural integrity of the perimeter is maintained. 

This requirement is concerned with ensuring there is periodic visual validation of structural integrity of secure room/collateral classified open storage area perimeters containing SIPRNet assets and associated media.  It ensures that any breach or attempted breach of the walls, true floors and true ceilings of a secure area (portions which are not readily visible) are discovered in a timely manner.

Protection must be established and maintained for all component devices or equipment that constitute the Automated Entry Control System (AECS) and/or the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) used to protect a vault, secure room or collateral classified open storage area, which contains SIPRNet assets.

If access to a junction box or controller will enable an unauthorized modification, then alarmed tamper protection, which is normally provided by a pressure sensitive switch must be used.  

Fixes:

1.  IDS/AECS components located both outside and inside the secure area must have tamper protection resulting in an alarm signal sent to the primary IDS Monitoring Station.  Normally this is provided by a pressure sensitive switch, which automatically sends an alarm signal when the protective enclosure covering component equipment is opened. 

2. ALL IDS/AECS ancillary equipment such as card readers, keypads, communication or interface devices for vaults, secure rooms, or collateral classified open storage areas containing SIPRNet assets must have tamper resistant enclosures and be securely fastened to the wall or other permanent structure.  Control panels and AECS devices located within a Secret or TS Controlled Access Area (CAA) need only a minimal degree of physical security protection sufficient to preclude unauthorized access to the mechanism.

Ensure the following configuration and control considerations are used as appropriate for the type of locks being used in access control systems protecting SIPRNet assets:

1.  Electric Strikes and/or Magnetic Locking devices used in access control systems shall be heavy duty, industrial grade.  

2.  Backup batteries and/or emergency power generators should be connected to (AECS) components; however, the total loss of power should be planned for.  

3. When used on secure rooms, vaults, or areas protecting SIPRNet equipment; electric strikes on doors will be set to fail secure in the event of power disruption.  

4. On the primary ingress/egress door to secure rooms (which contains the combination lock) the strike may be set to fail open to facilitate access to the room in emergencies only if the door is under continuous visual observation when the combination lock is not secure.  In this instance the combination lock will be immediately secured and subsequently opened as required to allow access to the room. 

5. As an alternative the strike on the primary access door (under continuous visual control) may be set to fail secure and configured to allow for opening of the strike lock with a key.  

6. Keys for such locks will be strictly controlled, inventoried periodically and not issued to individuals for retention. 

7. KEYS TO SECURE ROOMS WILL NOT BE REMOVED FROM THE SITE.

8. When Magnetic Locks (Mag locks) are used on primary access doors the total loss of ALL power (primary and backup) will cause the lock to fail open.  Therefore doors with mag locks installed must be under continuous visual observation when the combination lock is open.  

9. Where Mag locks are used on primary access doors and upon a total power failure  - the combination lock will be immediately secured and subsequently opened as required to allow access to the room.
  
10. Secondary doors not used for access (emergency egress only) should use standard locking door latches rather than electric strikes or mag locks.  

11. Access hardware on the side of the door that is external to the room must be removed to prevent use of secondary doors for routine ingress.  

12. In the event a mag lock is used on a secondary door, the door must be configured to be locked during a power disruption.  This can be accomplished with internal sliding deadbolt locks or supplemental door latches.  Any secondary door secured with Mag Locks must be under CONTINUOUS  visual observation when the interior deadbolt locks are not engaged.  Deadbolt locks must not be engaged while the room is occupied - for life safety, but will be secured upon closing the secure room or area. 

Always be sure to coordinate door locking and emergency egress considerations with supporting facility risk management(fire/safety) personnel.</fixtext><fix id="F-49205r770118_fix" /><check system="C-49250r770117_chk"><check-content-ref href="Traditional_Security_Checklist_None.xml" name="M" /><check-content>Vault/Secure Room Storage Standards - Automated Entry Control System (AECS) Door Lock Standards for Areas Containing SIPRNet Assets. 

Check to ensure the following configuration and control considerations are used according to the types of locking mechanisms being used, as specified in each check:

Check #1.  Electric Strikes and/or Magnetic Locking devices used in access control systems shall be heavy duty, industrial grade.  

Check #2.  Backup batteries and/or emergency power generators should be connected to AECS components; however, the total loss of power (primary and emergency) should also be planned for.  

Check #3. When used on secure rooms, vaults or areas protecting SIPRNet equipment, electric strikes on doors will be set to fail secure in the event of power disruption.  

Check #4. On the primary ingress/egress door to secure rooms (which contains the combination lock) the strike may be set to fail open to facilitate access to the room in emergencies only if the door is under continuous visual observation when the combination lock is not secure.  In this instance the combination lock will be immediately secured and subsequently opened as required to allow access to the room. 

Check #5. As an alternative the strike on the primary access door (only those under continuous visual control) may be set to fail secure and configured to allow for opening of the strike lock with a key.  

Check #6. Keys for locks as discussed in check 5 will be strictly controlled, inventoried periodically and not issued to individuals for personal retention. 

Check #7. KEYS TO SECURE ROOMS WILL NOT BE REMOVED FROM THE SITE.  

Check #8. When Magnetic Locks (Mag locks) are used on primary access doors the total loss of ALL power (primary and backup) will cause the lock to fail open.  Therefore doors with mag locks installed MUST BE UNDER CONTINUOUS VISUAL OBSERVATION WHEN THE COMBINATION LOCK IS OPEN.

Check #9. Where Mag locks are used on primary access doors and upon a total power failure  - the combination lock will be immediately secured and subsequently opened as required to allow access to the room.  

Check #10. Secondary doors not used for access (emergency egress only) should use standard locking door latches rather than electric strikes or mag locks.  

Check #11. Access hardware on the side of the secondary door that is external to the room must be removed to prevent use of secondary doors for routine ingress.  

Check #12. In the event a mag lock or electric strike is used on a secondary door, the door must be configured to be locked during a power disruption.  This can be accomplished with internal sliding deadbolt locks or lockable door latches.  Electric strikes on secondary doors should be set to fail secure.  Any secondary door secured with Mag Locks must be under CONTINUOUS visual observation when the interior deadbolt locks are not engaged.  Deadbolt locks must not be engaged while the room is occupied - for life safety, but will be secured upon closing the secure room or area.
                            
TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT:  This check is applicable where Secure Rooms are used to protect classified materials or systems in a tactical environment.

Permanent construction materials; while not impenetrable, provide physical evidence of an attempted or actual intrusion into a secure room space.  Construction materials and application techniques that are not permanent in nature can  potentially be removed to allow for access to secure room space and then replaced by an intruder upon egress from the area.  This effectively negates the detection capability afforded by permanent construction techniques and materials.  Examples of non-permanent material would be modular walls that can be removed and replaced with ease or plywood board (or other materials) applied with screws or nails that can be removed from outside the secure room space and then replaced using common tools.

In a classified operating environment, all unclassified items must be marked in addition to all classified items. For instance, in areas where any classified equipment such as servers, client workstations, printers, routers, crypto, etc. are being used, all classified equipment, media, and documents must be properly marked with classification levels and handling caveats. All unclassified equipment (servers, client workstations, printers, routers, crypto, etc.), media, and documents must also be properly marked as unclassified and with handling caveats, such as CUI, when appropriate.

Classified documents, information system (IS) equipment and removable media must be:

1. Under the direct personal control and observation of an authorized person, who possesses a security clearance and need-to know equal to or greater than the classified information or material being controlled.  The properly cleared employee(s) must be able to clearly see and control the classified material.  The employee(s) must be specifically aware the classified material is in their area AND that they are responsible for ensuring it is protected.

or

2.  Guarded by a trained professional security official who possesses a security clearance equal to or greater than the classified information or material being controlled. 

or

3. Stored in a locked security container (GSA approved safe), vault, secure room, collateral classified open storage area or SCIF with protection equal to or exceeding the highest classification of the material/equipment. 

Secondary Requirements:

Actions to enhance protection of classified materials:

1.  Site security personnel must conduct initial and annual training to indoctrinate and remind employees of procedures and requirements to maintain positive control of classified materials removed from approved storage. 

2.  Site security personnel must develop written procedures for protection and storage of classified materials and make the procedures readily available to each employee via electronic means, such as in space on an organizational intranet, shared folders or other means available.  

3. Site security personnel must conduct regular checks of their areas of responsibility and constantly be observant to ensure that classified materials (documents media, and equipment) that have been removed from approved storage are under the continuous personal observation and control of cleared persons.  

Tertiary Requirements:

Required Actions upon discovery of classified material not in secure storage or under continuous observation and control of a cleared employee:

1.  Site security personnel, security reviewers/inspectors, employees or anyone making discovery of classified material not in secure storage or under continuous observation and control of a cleared employee must immediately take control and properly secure any classified materials not under proper control when not in approved storage.  Second they must report the discovery to their supervisory chain and/or site security officials. 
 
2.  Site security personnel must initiate a preliminary inquiry if appropriate to determine the cause of the improperly secure material and to determine if any material was lost or compromised (security incident).  

3.  Site security personnel must develop written procedures for response to incidents of  classified materials found not in secure storage or under continuous observation and control of a cleared employee and make the procedures readily available to each employee via electronic means, such as in space on an organizational intranet, shared folders or other means available.  

4.  Site security personnel must conduct remedial training action subsequent to incidents of classified materials found not in secure storage or under continuous observation and control of a cleared employee to remind employees of procedures and requirements to maintain positive control of classified materials removed from approved storage.  

5.  Site managers/supervisors must discipline employees, as appropriate who do not comply with appropriate requirements to maintain positive control of classified material they have removed from secure storage.</fixtext><fix id="F-49211r770136_fix" /><check system="C-49256r770135_chk"><check-content-ref href="Traditional_Security_Checklist_None.xml" name="M" /><check-content>1. In areas containing SIPRNet assets - Check to ensure that classified documents, information system (IS) equipment and removable media that is not under the direct personal control and observation of an authorized person is guarded or stored in a locked security container (GSA approved safe), vault, secure room, collateral classified open storage area or SCIF with protection equal to or exceeding the highest classification of the material/equipment.  (CAT I)

2. Check to ensure that site security personnel develop written procedures for response to incidents of classified materials found not in secure storage or under continuous observation and control of a cleared employee and make the procedures readily available to each employee via electronic means, such as in space on an organizational intranet, shared folders or other means available. (CAT III)

Procedures for response to classified materials discovered that are not in proper storage or under proper control of a cleared person must include the following:

  a.  Site security personnel, security reviewers/inspectors, employees or anyone making discovery of classified material not in secure storage or under continuous observation and control of a cleared employee immediately take control and properly secure the classified materials not under proper control when not in approved storage.  Second they must report the discovery to their supervisory chain and/or site security officials.  (CAT III)

  b.  Site security personnel must initiate a preliminary inquiry if appropriate to determine the cause of the improperly secure material and to determine if any material was lost or compromised (security incident).  (CAT III)

  c.  Site security personnel must conduct remedial training action subsequent to incidents of classified materials found not in secure storage or under continuous observation and control of a cleared employee to remind employees of procedures and requirements to maintain positive control of classified materials removed from approved storage.  (CAT III)

  d.  Site managers/supervisors must discipline employees, as appropriate who do not comply with appropriate requirements to maintain positive control of classified material they have removed from secure storage. (CAT III)

3. Check to ensure that's site security personnel conduct initial and annual training to indoctrinate and remind employees of procedures and requirements to maintain positive control of classified materials removed from approved storage and measures to take upon discovery of classified material not in proper storage or under proper control of a cleared person. (CAT II)

Suggested methodology for reviewers:
During the review/walk-around be observant for classified materials (documents media, and equipment) that have been removed from approved storage.  Specifically look to determine if employees are maintaining positive control of the material.  Unless a properly cleared employee is able to clearly see and control the material - this will be a finding.

The employee(s) must be specifically aware the classified material is in their area AND that they are responsible for ensuring it is controlled/protected.  Just having cleared employee(s) "in the area" of the classified material or assuming other cleared employees in the area are responsible for the classified material is not sufficient control.

An example of a possible finding is when someone working on a classified system departs their work space (cube environment) for lunch or other type of break and does not ask another cleared employee to take control of their classified equipment, documents or media OR does not place the classified hard drive, classified documents and classified media in approved storage.

TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT:  This check is applicable in a tactical environment.

The only exception will be where there is a lack of permanent storage solutions for urgent (short term) tactical operations or other contingency situations.  Primarily this involves field/mobile environments where fixed facilities and equipment are not yet present or incapable of being used.  However, all classified equipment, documents or media not properly stored in a safe, vault or secure room must still be under the continuous observation and control of an appropriately cleared person.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-245826"><title>IS-06.03.01</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-245826r822883_rule" weight="10.0" severity="low"><version>IS-06.03.01</version><title>Non-Disclosure Agreement - Standard Form 312: no person may have access to classified information unless that person has a security clearance in accordance with DoDM 5200.02 and has signed a Standard Form (SF) 312, Classified Information Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), and access is essential to the accomplishment of a lawful and authorized Government function (i.e., has a need to know).</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Failure to verify clearance, need-to-know, and execute a non-disclosure agreement before granting access to classified can result in unauthorized personnel having access to classified.

1.  All classified information system processing locations must have physical and procedural controls to ensure that no unauthorized viewing of monitor screens is possible or occurring. This includes viewing by uncleared persons and/or those w/o need-to-know.  It also includes REL partners or other FN who may have been granted liberal physical access to areas where US ONLY classified is processed.  This is the primary purpose for this STIG Rule requirement.

2.  Classified monitor screens must not be visible or capable of being observed from outside the secure space (e.g., from common hallways or through doors or windows).
  
3.  There must be a visitor/escort control procedure in place (that it is actually being used) for announcing unauthorized/uncleared personnel in the area and that uncleared persons and/or those without the need-to-know (to include FN)  are continuously escorted when they are in the immediate vicinity of US classified workstations and components.
 
REQUIREMENTS ONLY FOR CLASSIFIED (SIPRNet) ENVIRONMENTS WITH FN PRESENCE:

4.  There must be local written procedures AND adequate documented proof of training (annually minimum) covering rules for interaction between US and FN employees.  All US and FN employees must be equally aware of the rules and procedures.  BOTH must be provided with applicable written guidance and training in this area.

5.  U.S.-only workstations must be "grouped" together in a U.S.-controlled workstation space when workstations are located in workspaces physically accessible by foreign nationals (such as combined operations centers).
 
6.  If the grouping of U.S.-only workstations at a site is not operationally possible, the following steps must be taken:

    a. The U.S. command or agency must authorize an exception at the site, in writing, stating operational reasons for exception, and maintain the record of exception.  This exception must be approved by the appropriate CC/S/A level of command, which is normally a 3 or 4 star Flag Officer level.
  
    b. Develop, publish, and maintain site specific written procedures on security measures to safeguard U.S.-only classified workstations. (in conjunction with written procedures under requirement #4)
 
    c. U.S. personnel must be briefed, trained (annually minimum) and enforce security measures. (in conjunction with training under requirement #4)

NOTE:  Requirement #6 is an allowable alternative to Requirement #5 and one or the other must be conducted.

7.  If a foreign national is permitted to view a US Only screen, U.S. personnel must first ensure:

    a.  Information is releasable in accordance with CC/S/A guidance and is consistent with National Disclosure Policy (NDP)-1; DoDD 5230.11; DoDD 5230.20; DoD Manual 5200.01; and CJCSI 5221.01.

    b.  The organization Foreign Disclosure Officer, Foreign Contact Officer, or Security Manager must be consulted to  ensure the foreign national has a security clearance granted by his or her government at a level equal to that of the classified information involved, and a Delegation of Disclosure Letter (DDL) has been issued to the specific FN partner to support the release of US classified information or material, and that there is an official need-to-know. </fixtext><fix id="F-49215r822887_fix" /><check system="C-49260r822886_chk"><check-content-ref href="Traditional_Security_Checklist_None.xml" name="M" /><check-content>BACKGROUND NOTE:  This requirement includes both situations where there is primarily a US Classified processing environment (no routine Foreign National (FN) presence) AND also contains guidance to be used for environments where FN are employed or present. It is arranged first by GUIDELINES FOR SITES WITHOUT A FN PRESENCE followed by GUIDELINES FOR ENVIRONMENTS WITH FN PRESENCE.
  
Following a lengthy discussion of the guidelines and considerations, the specific checks for this requirement are found, along with the default severity level applicable to each check.

Finally, guidance for applicability to tactical environments is provided.

GUIDELINES FOR SITES WITHOUT A FN PRESENCE:

The following physical controls should be used (individually or collectively) as a guide to evaluate compliance and can be recommended for site use; however, any method or combination of methods clearly being used successfully by the site under review may be acceptable.

POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS:
1. The best physical control solution is to locate all US Only classified terminals (open SIPRNet) in areas where only persons with at least a secret (or higher) security clearance have unescorted access. This type of area is commonly known as a secret Controlled Access Area (CAA). Placement of classified terminals in more highly controlled spaces like in secret or top secret (TS) vaults or secure rooms or SCIFs meets the access control requirements of a secret or TS CAA in addition to providing superior physical security of the location. Such additional physical security protection may be appropriate depending on organization mission and need to continually maintain classified information processing equipment within an open storage environment.
 
2.  Regardless of the type of environment in which classified work stations/monitors are located, ensuring that uncleared persons or those without need-to-know do not have easy access or inadvertent visibility to the classified monitor screens can be accomplished by placing (grouping together) the classified work stations in the back of such rooms/areas or behind partitions. This ensures uncleared visitors have limited opportunity to walk by a classified monitor and inadvertently be exposed to classified data.

3.  If isolation (grouping in controlled space) of the terminals is not practical, a privacy filter should be placed on each classified (SIPRNET) monitor to prevent ease of observation by any unauthorized individual simply passing by. This is a good idea even if other physical controls of classified work stations are used. The use of the privacy filters is an excellent alternative solution where physical separation or repositioning of monitors in rooms is not possible due to space limitations.

4. Classified monitor screens should not be placed facing doorways or windows through which public or unrestricted viewing of the monitor is possible. If space limitations do not allow for such placement then ensuring doors are closed or that windows are covered by screens or blinds during classified processing can be used - but only if this procedure is part of documented security procedures and security training.
  
5. Finally a solution for areas where work stations (cubes) are used is to place doors or the less costly cube screens across the openings for use when classified work is being conducted.

ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:
While the "possible solutions" cover a range of suggest compliance possibilities the following covers an absolute requirement for which there can be no exception:

1.  When uncleared visitors need to enter CAAs, secure rooms, vaults or SCIFs where classified work stations are located there must be a procedure to ensure their presence is announced before entering. This will allow time for screens and classified material to be covered from view.
  
2.  All uncleared visitors must be under continuous escort by a properly cleared employee while within the CAA/secure room/vault/or SCIF. 

GUIDELINES FOR ENVIRONMENTS WITH FN PRESENCE:
  
Environments where FN are present (may even be embedded as US DoD employees) require even more diligence and additional considerations for protection of US Only classified (SIPRNet) terminal screens/workstation screens and monitors. This is because while sharing of certain specific classified information may be permitted, there is always the possibility that US Only or NOFORN information may also be present within the physical environment or accessible on visible/unprotected workstation screens.

Foreign Nationals, even if they are embedded partners in US DoD operations, are not afforded access to any and all US classified information. This erroneous assumption is prevalent in many CC/S/A operation centers where FN liaison and exchange personnel are routinely present. Release of US classified information can only be made to FN partners if specifically compliant with National Disclosure Policy, has been determined releasable to the Foreign National's host country and a Delegation of Disclosure Letter (DDL) has been issued to the specific FN partner to support the release of US classified information or material.

*Where FN are present (regardless of their authorized physical and systems access or security clearance) - US Only work stations and network equipment must be under strict US control at all times.
  
This process involves a combination of physical control measures AND employee awareness. Reviewers must use a flexible approach with an understanding of the synergistic relationship of physical controls and employee awareness to properly evaluate compliance.

REGULATORY STANDARD FOR ENVIRONMENTS WITH FN PRESENCE: This relationship of physical protective measures with employee awareness gained through procedures and training is based on the following excerpt from CJCSI 6510-01F: 
In areas where there is the potential for Foreign National Access to U.S.-Only Workstations and Network Equipment, CC/S/As shall:

1.  Maintain strict U.S. control of U.S.-only workstations and network equipment at all times. This includes network equipment such as printers, copiers, and faxes.

2.  Group U.S.-only workstations together in a U.S.-controlled workstation space when workstations are located in workspaces physically accessible by foreign nationals (such as combined operations centers).

3.  If the grouping of U.S.-only workstations at a site is not operationally possible, the following steps shall be taken:

    a. The U.S. command or agency shall authorize an exception at the site, in writing, stating operational reasons for exception, and maintain the record of exception. NOTE: this exception must be approved by the appropriate CC/S/A level of command, which is normally a 3 or 4 star Flag Officer.

    b. Develop, publish, and maintain specific site written procedures on security measures to safeguard U.S.-only classified workstations.

    c. Ensure that U.S. personnel are briefed and enforce security measures.
    
4.  Announce presence. If a foreign national is permitted access to U.S.-controlled workstation space, the individual must be announced, must wear a badge clearly identifying him or her as a foreign national, and must be escorted at all times. In addition, a warning light must be activated if available and screens must be covered or blanked.

5.  If the foreign national is permitted to view the screen, U.S. personnel must ensure:

    a.  Information is releasable in accordance with CC/S/A guidance and shall be consistent with National Disclosure Policy (NDP)-1; DoDD 5230.11; DoDD 5230.20; DoD Manual 5200.01; and CJCSI 5221.01.

    b.  Check with organization security office to ensure foreign national has security clearances granted by his or her government at a level equal to that of the classified information involved and an official need-to-know.

POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS:
The following physical controls should be used (individually or collectively) as a guide to evaluate compliance and can be recommended for site use; however, any method or combination of methods clearly being used successfully by the site under review may be acceptable:

1.  The "best physical control solution" is to locate all US Only terminals in areas where the FN do not have easy access or visibility to the monitor screens. This can be accomplished by placing them in the back of rooms/areas or behind partitions. Normally if US Only SIPRNet PCs are placed in the back of a room or within the secure space the REL/FN  work stations would then be placed near the front of the area to reduce the frequency of FN officers passing by US Only SIPRNet (or other US Only classified) work stations. When FN employees need to enter areas where US Only work stations are located there should be a procedure to ensure their presence is announced before entering. This will allow time for screens and classified material not releasable to FN to be covered from view.

2.  If isolation of the terminals is not practical, a privacy filter should be placed on each US Only classified (SIPRNET) monitor to prevent ease of observation by any unauthorized individual. This is a good idea even if physical separation of US Only and REL/FN work stations is used. The use of the privacy filters is the best alternative "physical control solution" where physical separation in rooms is not possible due to space limitations and/or the impeding of interaction between US personnel and FN partners.
 
3.  Another acceptable physical security alternative solution for areas where work stations (cubes) are used is to place doors or the less costly cube screens across the openings for when classified work (especially on the US Only cubes) is being performed.
                                                   
4. Finally, in addition to any physical separation, obscuration or other control measures in place (or lack thereof) written local policy/procedures and initial/recurring training are absolutely necessary to ensure that all US personnel are:

    a.  Aware of REL/FN Officers presence in common work areas when working on non-releasable applications/sites on the SIPRNet and

    b.  Aware of exactly what classified or sensitive information is not releasable.

ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:
While the "possible solutions" cover a range of suggest compliance possibilities the following covers an absolute requirement for which there can be no exception:

1.  When uncleared visitors need to enter CAAs, secure rooms, vaults or SCIFs where classified work stations are located there must be a procedure to ensure their presence is announced before entering. This will allow time for screens and classified material to be covered from view.
  
2.  All uncleared visitors must be under continuous escort by a properly cleared employee while within the CAA/secure room/vault/or SCIF.
 
3.  Announce presence of Foreign Nationals (FN). If a foreign national is permitted access to U.S.-controlled workstation space, the individual must be announced, must wear a badge clearly identifying him or her as a foreign national, and must be escorted at all times. In addition, a warning light must be activated if available and screens must be covered or blanked.

4. If the foreign national is permitted to view a US Only screen, U.S. personnel must ensure:

    a.  Information is releasable in accordance with CC/S/A guidance and is consistent with National Disclosure Policy (NDP)-1; DoDD 5230.11; DoDD 5230.20; DoD Manual 5200.01; and CJCSI 5221.01.

    b. A check with the organization security office is conducted to ensure the foreign national has security clearances granted by his or her government at a level equal to that of the classified information involved, that an appropriate DDL is on-hand to validate the security clearance and release of US classified information, and that there is an official need-to-know.

CHECKS FOR *BOTH* US ONLY CLASSIFIED (SIPRNet) ENVIRONMENTS WITHOUT FN PRESENCE AND ENVIRONMENTS WITH FN PRESENCE:

1.  CHECK all classified monitor locations to ensure that no unauthorized viewing is possible or occurring. This includes viewing by uncleared persons and/or those w/o need-to-know. It also includes REL partners or other FN who may have been granted liberal physical access to areas where US ONLY classified is processed. This check is the primary action for reviewers under this requirement. (CAT I)

2.  CHECK/validate that classified monitors cannot be observed from outside the secure space (e.g., from common hallways or through doors or windows).  (CAT I)

3.  CHECK access control procedures and observe actual escort procedures. Ensure there is a process (and that it is actually being used) for announcing unauthorized/uncleared personnel in the area and that uncleared persons and/or those without the need-to-know (to include FN)  are continuously escorted when they are in the immediate vicinity of US classified workstations and components. (CAT I)

CHECKS *ONLY FOR* CLASSIFIED (SIPRNet) ENVIRONMENTS WITH *FN PRESENCE*:

4.  CHECK to ensure there are local written procedures AND adequate documented proof of training (annually minimum) covering rules for interaction between US and FN employees.  All US and FN employees must be equally aware of the rules and procedures.  BOTH must be provided with applicable written guidance and training in this area. (CAT II)

5.  CHECK that U.S.-only workstations are "grouped" together in a U.S.-controlled workstation space when workstations are located in workspaces physically accessible by foreign nationals (such as combined operations centers). (CAT II)

6.  CHECK that If the grouping of U.S.-only workstations at a site is not operationally possible, the following steps have been taken:

    a. The U.S. command or agency has authorized an exception at the site, in writing, stating operational reasons for exception, and maintain the record of exception.  This exception must be approved by the appropriate CC/S/A level of command, which is normally a 3 or 4 star Flag Officer level.  (CAT II)

    b. Develop, publish, and maintain site specific written procedures on security measures to safeguard U.S.-only classified workstations. (in conjunction with written procedures required for CHECK #4) (CAT II)

    c. Ensure that U.S. personnel are briefed, trained (annually minimum) and enforce security measures.  (in conjunction with training required for CHECK #4) (CAT II)

NOTE:  CHECK #6 is an allowable alternative to CHECK #5 and one or the other must be conducted.

7.  CHECK that if a foreign national is permitted to view a US Only screen, U.S. personnel have ensured:

    a.  Information is releasable in accordance with CC/S/A guidance and is consistent with National Disclosure Policy (NDP)-1; DoDD 5230.11; DoDD 5230.20; DoD Manual 5200.01; and CJCSI 5221.01. (CAT I)

    b.  The organization Foreign Disclosure Officer, Foreign Contact Officer, or Security Manager was consulted to  ensure the foreign national has a security clearance granted by his or her government at a level equal to that of the classified information involved, and a Delegation of Disclosure Letter (DDL) has been issued to the specific FN partner to support the release of US classified information or material, and that there is an official need-to-know. (CAT I)

TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT:
 
1. This check is applicable for all classified processing environments including a field/mobile environment. Commanders in such environments may use whatever means available or feasible to control unauthorized physical access to classified monitors.
  
2.  This check is applicable where REL Partners or other FN allies are employed within fixed facilities located in a theater of operations (tactical environment) with physical access to US Classified or Sensitive Systems.

3.  Wherever classified systems/with screens/monitors are used, uncleared persons must always be escorted when permitted in the physical processing environment.

</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;The DoD Common Access Cards (CAC) a "smart" card, is the standard identification for active-duty military personnel, Selected Reserve, DoD civilian employees, and eligible contractor personnel.  It is also the principal card used to enable physical access to buildings and controlled spaces, and it provides access to defense computer networks and systems. 
 
The card, which is the property of the U.S. Government, is required to be in the personal custody of the member at all times.

System Access Tokens are also used on the SIPRNet and the cards along with a Personal identity Number (PIN) can be used to access classified information on the SIPRNet in lieu of a logon ID and password.

CAC and SIPRNet tokens are very important components for providing both physical and logical access control to DISN assets and must therefore be strictly controlled.

Physically co-locating REL Partners or other FN - who have limited access to the SIPRNet or other US Classified systems - near US personnel in a collateral classified (Secret or higher) open storage area or in a Secret or higher Controlled Access Area (CAA) that processes classified material is permissible for operational efficiency and coordination.
  
Failure to limit access to information systems is especially important in mixed US/FN environments.   This is particularly important on US Only classified terminals when not personally and physically attended by US personnel.  The failure to properly disable information workstations and monitor screens when unattended can result in FN personnel having unauthorized access to classified information, which can result in the loss or compromise of classified information, including NOFORN information. 

Appropriate but simple physical and procedural security measures must be put in place to ensure that unauthorized persons to include FN partners do not have unauthorized access to information not approved for release to them.  Control of CACs, SIPRNet tokens and locking of computer work stations when unattended is an important aspect of proper procedural security measure implementation.

This could result in a longer duration of the security deficiency before corrective action is taken and make discovery of factual information concerning what caused the security incident and assigning responsibility and remedial actions more difficult. Ultimately the failure to perform consistent EOD checks can lead to the loss or compromise of classified or sensitive information.

SF 701, "Activity Security Checklist," must be used to record these checks. 

In addition to the SF 701, the responsible site or organization should have a written procedure to outline the end-of-day check process and to guide checkers with their duties. For instance the procedure should include instructions on how to handle any classified information that is found outside of proper storage.

An integral part of the security check system must incorporate the securing of all vaults, secure rooms, and containers used for storing classified material. SF 702, "Security Container Check Sheet," must be used to record each opening, closing, and verification checks of these storage mediums.  

Area verification checks will be recorded on the SF 701 upon completion of end-of-day checks.  Following are recommended end-of-day checks, which should be included on the SF 701, but ultimately the checks must be tailored to fit the physical configuration and mission of the site:                                                      
a. Activation of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) alarm sensors where applicable.
b.  All classified material has been properly stored.                                                     
c.  Removal of CAC Cards and SIPRNet tokens from workstations.
d.  All windows, doors or other openings are properly secured.                                          
e.  Verification of lock box closure for SIPRNet wall jacks and PDS lines, where applicable.
f.  Additional checks such as turning off of coffee pots and lights, power-off of printers/MFDs, securing of STE keys, etc. can be identified and accomplished as part of the check.
g. The SF 701, Activity Security Checklist shall be used to record these checks, to include after hours, weekend and holiday activities.
                                               
Results of end-of-day checks (SF 701 forms) should be retained for at least 30 days (or otherwise as required by Component records management schedules) after completion of the monthly form to ensure availability for audits and resolution of subsequent discovery of security incidents or discrepancies.  While 24/7 operational areas storing classified materials do not necessarily require end-of-day (EOD) checks it is highly recommended that a system of checks be instituted (similar to EOD checks) upon each change of shift.  Such checks jointly conducted by incoming and outgoing supervisors can be used to verify the integrity of safes and classified equipment/materials under their control and can be used to narrow the window of time for a preliminary inquiry should a security incident occur.</fixtext><fix id="F-49218r770157_fix" /><check system="C-49263r822891_chk"><check-content-ref href="Traditional_Security_Checklist_None.xml" name="M" /><check-content>Organizations that process or store classified information must establish a system of security checks at the close of each duty and/or business day to ensure that any area where classified information is used or stored is secure.

1.  Unless the MFD can be properly purged of all classified data or images after each use for classified - it must be housed in an area approved for open storage of classified material.  Most current copiers, printers, scanners and facsimile machines or multi-functional devices (MFD) contain hard drives that collect and store images and data.  

Therefore these machines must be maintained in space approved for open storage of classified (secret or higher for SIPRNet).    

NOTE:  Clearing of hard drives (such as by overwriting) is not adequate to sanitize a classified hard drive (magnetic or solid state) so that it can be deemed unclassified and left unattended in an area not approved for classified open storage.  This is regardless of the number of times the drive is over-written.  A hard drive (magnetic or solid state) can only be sanitized (made unclassified) by degaussing and/or physical destruction, thereby rending the drive no longer usable.  
 
2. If not maintained within a secret or higher collateral classified open storage area and hard drives (non-volatile memory) ARE NOT present:
  
MFD (or individual copiers, scanners, printers or facsimile machines) must be properly purged (AKA: sanitized) of classified data or images after each period of reproducing classified and be maintained in space where access is controlled to at least the level of the classified material authorized to be copied on the machine.  This type of area is referred to as a Controlled Access Area (CAA) - at least a secret CAA or TS CAA for SIPRNet connections.  
Sanitizing a MFD means it can be considered and treated as an unclassified device.
  
NOTE:  Hard drives with non-volatile memory cannot be sanitized by current overwriting/clearing procedures and must be destroyed to be considered sanitized/unclassified.  Hence MFD with non-volatile memory cannot be sanitized for reuse.
  
Only those MFD with entirely volatile memory can be sanitized and reused with removal of power from the device.  It is important to note that powering down the machine will be a necessary part of this procedure to ensure that volatile memory is totally erased and sanitized so that it can be considered to be an unclassified device.  Documented procedures must be on-hand for this process.

3.  If not maintained within a secret or higher collateral classified open storage area and hard drives (non-volatile memory) ARE present:
 
MFD (or individual copiers, scanners, printers or facsimile machines) with hard drives (non-volatile memory) must be located and operated in a secret or higher CAA and the hard drive must be promptly removed after each use (or otherwise when unattended by cleared employees) and stored in a GSA approved safe. 
 
It is important to note that powering down the machine will still be a necessary part of this procedure to ensure that volatile memory is totally erased and sanitized so that it can be considered to be an unclassified device. There must be documented procedures on-hand for this process. 

NOTE:  Despite the mitigations in 2 and 3 above, there is still a concern that the procedure will not be accomplished promptly or successfully each time and that the risk for printed or copied classified documents to be left unattended for periods of time in the MFD machines still exists.  Therefore vulnerability still exists and must be considered as a potential finding.

Checks: 
 
1.  Unless the MFD can be properly purged and sanitized (made unclassified) of all classified data or images after each use for classified - it must be housed in an area approved for open storage of classified material.  

Most current copiers, printers, scanners and facsimile machines or multi-functional devices (MFD) contain hard drives that collect and store images and data.  

Therefore check to ensure that such machines are maintained in space approved for open storage of classified (secret or higher for SIPRNet).  

NOTE that to be properly sanitized means that the MFD can be treated as an unclassified piece of equipment once a successful purge of data or images is completed. (CAT I) 

2.  If not maintained within a secret or higher collateral classified open storage area:  

Check that MFD (or individual copiers, scanners, printers or facsimile machines) do not have hard drives containing non-volatile memory in the device and that the volatile memory is purged/sanitized of all classified data or images after each use.

Additionally check that these MFD are maintained in space where access is controlled to at least the level of the classified material authorized to be copied on the machine. This type of area is referred to as a Controlled Access Area (CAA) - at least a secret CAA or TS CAA for SIPRNet connections.
  
ONLY those MFD with entirely volatile memory can be sanitized and reused upon removal of power from the device.  

Check to ensure that powering down the machine is a part of the MFD sanitization procedure to ensure that volatile memory is totally erased and sanitized so that it can be considered to be an unclassified device.  Documented procedures must be on-hand for this process.
 
NOTE:  Sanitizing a MFD means it can be considered and treated as an unclassified device.  Hard drives with non-volatile memory cannot be sanitized by current overwriting/clearing procedures and must be destroyed (degaussing and/or physical destruction) to be considered sanitized/unclassified.  Hence MFD with non-volatile memory cannot be sanitized for reuse.  Only MFD with volatile memory can be sanitized for reuse.  

Only if ALL of the sub-checks listed under check 2 are compliant is it a CAT II finding.  Otherwise if ANY of the sub-checks are not compliant it remains a CAT I finding. (CAT II)

3.  If not maintained within a secret or higher collateral classified open storage area and hard drives with non-volatile memory are present: 

Check to ensure MFD (or individual copiers, scanners, printers or facsimile machines) are located in a secret or higher CAA and the hard drive is promptly removed after each use and stored in a GSA approved safe.  

Check to ensure that powering down the machine is a required part of this procedure to ensure that volatile memory is totally erased and sanitized so that it can be considered to be an unclassified device.   

Check that documented procedures are on hand to support this process. 

Only if ALL of the sub-checks listed under check 3 are compliant is it a CAT II finding.  Otherwise if ANY of the sub-checks are not compliant it remains a CAT I finding. 
(CAT II)

EXPLANATION for CAT II FINDINGS:  Despite the mitigations in checks 2 and 3 above, there is still a concern that the mitigation procedure will not be accomplished promptly or successfully each time and there is a risk for printed or copied classified documents to be left unattended for periods of time in the networked MFD machines, especially when printed from a remote workstation location.  Therefore, since a potential vulnerability still exists it is still considered as a CAT II finding.

TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT:  This check is applicable in a fixed operational facility in a tactical environment if classified equipment is used or documents or media are created/extracted from the SIPRNet.  The only exception will be for urgent (short term) tactical operations or other contingency situations where fixed facilities and equipment are not yet present or incapable of being used.

Reproduced material is to be placed under the same accountability and control requirements as applied to the original material.     

Classified material is to be reproduced only on approved and, when applicable, properly accredited systems. 

Ensure:
  
1. Procedures for the proper reproduction of classified documents are posted on or near the MFD approved for classified reproduction.  This is especially true when the MFD is capable of directly making copies of documents on the machine. The procedures must alert users when the particular MFD is approved for classified reproduction.
  
2. Other MFD (used as copiers) in the organization that are not approved for classified document reproduction must also be marked to alert users of the prohibition against making classified copies. 
  
3. Procedures posted near the MFD must contain steps for users to take after printing, copying, scanning or faxing classified documents.  Steps must include double checking of the MFD for missed pages, counting original and copied pages, purging of images (if applicable), use of cover sheets, and general protection/control guidelines for reproduced documents. 

NOTE:  Most MFD contain both hard drives (non-volatile memory) and volatile memory and cannot be properly sanitized of classified data or images to make the MFD unclassified.  Therefore, most (if not all) classified MFD should be housed and operated within space approved for collateral classified open storage.  If not maintained in spaces approved for classified open storage all MFD with non-volatile memory  that is used for classified reproduction must be under the continuous observation and control of a cleared person AT ALL TIMES.</fixtext><fix id="F-49221r770166_fix" /><check system="C-49266r822895_chk"><check-content-ref href="Traditional_Security_Checklist_None.xml" name="M" /><check-content>Classified Reproduction - Document Copying using Multi-Functional Device (MFD) machines (i.e., printer, copier, fax, scanner) connected to SIPRNet.

CLASSIFIED automated information system (AIS) data processing/storage devices such as system hard drives and media must be properly sanitized using approved NSA guidelines (purged of all classified data so that recovery using known laboratory attack is not possible) before such equipment or media is disposed of or placed in use (and/or stored) in a lower classification environment or an unclassified environment.  

NOTE 1: Clearing procedures using overwrite software is not sufficient to dispose of classified equipment or media (for instance by release to property disposal, vendors, or placement in trash) or to re-use it in an unclassified or lesser classification environment other than its original classification level.  Clearing will only enable the equipment or media to be re-used within the original classified environment. 

NOTE 2:  NSA guidance for classified equipment can be found in the NSA/CSA Policy Manual 9-12, NSA/CSS Storage Device Declassification Manual.  Sanitization and disposal must also be IAW Enclosure 3 and Enclosure 7 of Volume 3 of DoD Manual 5200.01, which provides additional clarifying guidance for the DoD.  Some important excerpts from this guidance pertaining to classified equipment and storage media follows:
Classified IT storage media (e.g., hard drives) cannot be declassified by overwriting.
Sanitization (which may destroy the usefulness of the media) or physical destruction is required for disposal.

NOTE 3:  The specific methods and procedures for sanitization of classified hard drives or storage media differ depending on sensitivity of data, type of hard drive or storage media (magnetic, solid state, etc...) and ownership of the hard drive or storage media. To ensure DoD information is not inadvertently disclosed to unauthorized individuals, the activity security manager should coordinate with the local Authorizing Official (AO) and/or IT staff to ensure local procedures for disposal of computer hard drives appropriately address removal of U.S. Government data prior to disposal.</fixtext><fix id="F-49223r822899_fix" /><check system="C-49268r822898_chk"><check-content-ref href="Traditional_Security_Checklist_None.xml" name="M" /><check-content>For CLASSIFIED automated information system (AIS) data processing and/or storage equipment such as hard drives and media:

1. Unclassified Hard Drives:  

a.  When no longer needed, unclassified computer systems and hard drives may be disposed of outside the Department of Defense. In some circumstances, the equipment may be provided to non-government entities for reutilization. To ensure that no data or information remains on operable unclassified hard drives that are transferred or permanently removed from DoD custody, the drives must be sanitized by overwriting. 

b.  Where overwriting is inappropriate or cannot be completely accomplished (e.g., inoperable disk) the drives are to be totally removed from service (i.e., thrown away).  In this case the drives must be physically destroyed before disposal.  

c.  The specific methods and procedures differ depending on sensitivity of data and ownership of the hard drive. To ensure DoD information is not inadvertently disclosed to unauthorized individuals, the activity security manager should coordinate with the local DAA and/or IT staff to ensure local procedures for disposal of computer hard drives appropriately address removal of U.S. Government data prior to disposal. (See Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence Memorandum, Disposition of Unclassified DoD Computer Hard Drives, June 4, 2001 for detailed guidance.) Generally the use of Hard Drive degaussers with an appropriate strength (Coercivity of magnetic field) for the drive being erased (Oestrid rating) is recommended as part of the requirement for physical destruction. After degaussing the hard drive the physical destruction of individual platters should be accomplished to make attempted data retrieval impractical.

2.  Unclassified Automated Information System (AIS) Media:

a. Various types of AIS media may contain CUI and must be disposed of in accordance with guidance in the NIST Special Publication 800-88, Guidelines for Media Sanitization.   

b. NSA/CSS publishes lists of products that meet specific performance criteria for sanitizing, destroying or disposing of various types of media containing sensitive or classified information.  The lists are available at http://www.nsa.gov/ia/guidance/media_destruction_guidance/index.shtml or by calling (410)854-6358. 

3.  Unclassified documents:

a. Record copies of FOUO documents shall be disposed of in accordance with the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. 33 and Component records management directives. 

b. Non-record FOUO documents may be destroyed by shredding or tearing into pieces and discarding the pieces in regular trash containers.  

c. NOTE: The guidance provided here is for FOUO paper documents and this is the least stringent standard found for any CUI document destruction.  There are other types of  CUI, such as DEA Sensitive material, which must be destroyed by a means approved for destruction of Confidential material. Be certain to check DoD Manual 5200.01 for specific destruction requirements for each type of CUI document.  

4. Additional considerations:

a. Periodically inspect recycle bins, regular trash, and the availability of shredders or collection containers for sensitive material.   Ensure it is known who gets the recycling (especially if it contains CUI) and that it is disposed of properly.  NOTE:  If you find (e.g., in the trash) and can easily reconstruct any document marked FOUO (or other CUI document) and it contains extremely sensitive information such as PII (with SSN, etc.), this should be investigated and corrective actions taken immediately.  

b. While not required it is highly recommended using at least a cross cut shredder for destruction of CUI documents.  Further, while a shred-all policy is also not required, this is another strong recommendation.</fixtext><fix id="F-49230r822910_fix" /><check system="C-49275r822909_chk"><check-content-ref href="Traditional_Security_Checklist_None.xml" name="M" /><check-content>Check to ensure compliance with appropriate methods for disposal of the following:

For most CUI and FOUO specifically ensure the following standards are met: 

1.  During working hours, reasonable steps shall be taken to minimize the risk of access by unauthorized personnel.  This would include things like placing cover sheets on FOUO documents and allowing unescorted access to areas where CUI (documents and AIS storage media) is processed/handled to only those persons with at least a favorably adjudicated National Agency Check (NAC). 

2.  After working hours, FOUO information (documents and AIS storage media) may be stored in unlocked containers, desks, or cabinets if Government or Government-contract building security is provided. If such building security is not provided or is deemed inadequate, the information (documents and AIS storage media) shall be stored in locked desks, file cabinets, bookcases, locked rooms, etc.  In all cases FOUO and other CUI must be placed out of sight during non-working hours. While not required, implementation of a clean desk policy would be a good idea.  

3.  Unescorted access to computer rooms or areas containing major items of AIS equipment processing CUI information (servers and network components) should only be granted to persons with at least a favorable NAC.  All others should be physically escorted. Access control measures such as reception personnel, guards, keyed locks, cipher locks or automated access control systems may be used to control access to such areas.</fixtext><fix id="F-49231r770196_fix" /><check system="C-49276r770195_chk"><check-content-ref href="Traditional_Security_Checklist_None.xml" name="M" /><check-content>General Guidance:  

Standards of protection for most types of CUI are the same as for FOUO but some variance does exist.  Therefore, specific requirements for certain CUI may need to be checked against applicable references to ensure proper protection is afforded.  The checks are applicable to all forms of CUI: documents, AIS hard drives and storage media.

Checks:

For most CUI and FOUO specifically check to ensure the following standards are met: 

Check #1.  During working hours, reasonable steps shall be taken to minimize the risk of access by unauthorized personnel.  This would include things like placing cover sheets on FOUO documents and allowing unescorted access to areas where CUI (documents and AIS storage media) is processed/handled to only those persons with at least a favorably adjudicated National Agency Check (NAC). 

Check #2.  After working hours, FOUO information (documents and removable media) may be stored in unlocked containers, desks, or cabinets if Government or Government-contract building security is provided. If such building security is not provided or is deemed inadequate, the information (documents and removable media) shall be stored in locked desks, file cabinets, bookcases, locked rooms, etc.  In all cases FOUO and other CUI documents must be placed out of sight during non-working hours. While not required, recommending implementation of a clean desk policy would be appropriate.

Check #3.  Unescorted access to computer rooms or areas containing major items of AIS equipment processing CUI information (servers and network components) should only be granted to persons with at least a favorable NAC.  All others should be physically escorted. Access control measures such as reception personnel, guards, keyed locks, cipher locks or automated access control systems may be used to control access to such areas.                                      

TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT: The check is applicable for fixed (established) tactical processing environments where procedural documents (SOPs) should be in place.  Not applicable to a field/mobile environment.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-245846"><title>IS-16.02.04</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-245846r770200_rule" weight="10.0" severity="medium"><version>IS-16.02.04</version><title>Controlled Unclassified Information - Encryption of Data at Rest</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Failure to handle CUI in an approved manner can result in the loss or compromise of sensitive information.

When developing an organizational program to validate security clearance information for systems access and/or physical access to SIPRNet work environments, the first thing to consider is there are various categories of personnel and associated considerations with each one.  These categories include:  Military employees, Government Civilian employees, Contract employees, Foreign Nationals and Local National employees under a Status of Forces (SOFA) agreement and Visitors. 

The minimum security clearance requirement for systems access to the SIPRNet or unescorted access to the physical environment surrounding SIPRNet system information technology assets is secret.

Generally, an organization validation of security clearance levels should come from official databases such as JPAS, DCII, a service or agency data base or "high level" (major subordinate command) headquarters security office.  Also note that organization manning (staffing) documents should include the required clearance level for each assigned Military and Civilian position.

Local procedures must be developed for verifying that all personnel with access to classified information systems (logical or physical access) have the appropriate security clearance and access authorization.  

Fixes:

1. Ensure that organizational manning (staffing) records (*security clearance requirements for the position occupied) match the actual security clearance held by the incumbent employee (military or DoD civilian) as reflected in JPAS. Review all the organization personnel security records and compare with applicable System Access Authorization Request (SAAR) forms to ensure proper validation of clearance levels. Be especially aware of ALL those who have "privileged" systems access or responsibility for systems security oversight (such as SAs, ISSM, ISSOs, Network Admin, etc.) and ensure that correct clearance and IT assurance levels have been granted.

2.  If there are contract employees with systems and/or physical access to SIPRNet, ensure there is a Statement of Work with accompanying DD 254 (Contract Security Specification) that covers security clearance requirements for each type of work being performed by contractors. Review contractor records (those physical assigned to the site or working remotely on projects for the organization) to ensure they actually have the required security clearances.

3.  Ensure that a delegation of disclosure authority letter (DDL) is on-hand in all cases where US Classified information is released/shared with Foreign National Exchange or Liaison personnel.  

4. Ensure that a Limited Access Authorization (LAA) is on hand when system access to classified information is granted to an immigrant alien or a foreign national - not associated with or representing a foreign government.  

5.  Ensure there is an organizational procedure developed to outline methodology for validation and maintenance of required security clearances.</fixtext><fix id="F-49242r770229_fix" /><check system="C-49287r770228_chk"><check-content-ref href="Traditional_Security_Checklist_None.xml" name="M" /><check-content>Background Information:

When checking how an organization validates security clearance information for either systems or physical access the first thing to consider is that there are various categories of personnel and associated considerations with each one.  These categories include:  Military employees, Government Civilian employees, Contract employees, Foreign Nationals and Local National employees under a Status of Forces (SOFA) agreement and Visitors. 

Generally, an organization validation of security clearance levels should come from official databases such as JPAS, DCII, a service or agency data base or "high level" (major subordinate command) headquarters security office.  Also note that organization manning (staffing) documents should include the required clearance level for each assigned Military and Civilian position.  Staffing documents should be requested by inspectors for review.

The minimum security clearance requirement for systems access to the SIPRNet or unescorted access to the physical environment surrounding SIPRNet system information technology assets is secret.

Local procedures must be developed for verifying that all personnel with access to classified information systems (logical or physical access) have the appropriate security clearance and access authorization.  Inspectors should review local procedures.

Checks:

Check #1. Review a sample of the organization personnel security records (from local data bases, physical files, JPAS...) and compare with applicable System Access Authorization Request (SAAR) forms to ensure proper validation of clearance levels for access to the SIPRNet (both logical systems access and/or physical access to SIPRNet environments).  Minimum of secret security clearance is required.  Check organizational records against the JPAS data base if possible.  Ensure that organizational manning records (security clearance requirements for the position occupied) match the actual security clearance held by the incumbent employee (military or DoD civilian) as reflected in JPAS. 
Because it is generally not feasible to review all records it is recommended to select where possible ALL those who have "privileged" systems access or responsibility for oversight of systems security (such as SAs, ISSM, ISSOs, Network Admin, etc.) along with key management personnel (commander/director, ISSM, division/branch chiefs, etc.) and supplement with a random sample of those with basic "user" access to systems.

Check #2.  If there are contractor employees with classified systems access (SIPRNet) (both logical and/or physical access) - check to ensure there is a Statement of Work with accompanying DD 254 ("Classified" Contract Security Specification) that covers security clearance requirements for each type of work (or specified positions) being performed by contractors.
  
Check #3.  Check to ensure that contractor employees performing the tasks outlined in the Statement of Work and/or DD Form 254 actually have the security clearance required by the contract - minimum secret for SIPRNet access.  If possible validate this in the JPAS data base.

Check #4.  Check that a delegation of disclosure authority letter (DDL) is on-hand in all cases where US Classified information is released/shared with Foreign National Exchange or Liaison personnel who are either assigned to or visiting the site.  The DDL will reflect the level of security clearance the FN official has and the level and type of information authorized to be shared.

Check #5. Check to ensure that a Limited Access Authorization (LAA) is on hand when system access (or physical access) to classified information is granted to an immigrant alien or a foreign national - not associated with or representing a foreign government.  

TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT: The check is applicable for fixed (established) tactical processing environments and is also applicable to a field/mobile environment.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-245860"><title>PE-07.03.01</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-245860r822921_rule" weight="10.0" severity="low"><version>PE-07.03.01</version><title>Out-processing Procedures for Departing or Terminated Employees (Military, Government Civilian and Contractor)</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Failure to properly out-process through the security section allows the possibility of continued (unauthorized) access to the facility and/or the systems.

NOTE 1:  If a higher level installation or base plan is used ensure that it specifically addresses security concerns/procedures for the inspected organization or site.  Ideally, a local site or organization should always be included in the host installation security plan. If not, then a separately developed local (site/organization) Physical Security Plan (and/or Systems Security Plan (SSP)) is required, which integrates local security procedures for the site with the security-in-depth (SID) measures detailed in the host installation PSP.  The installation level PSP will likely not address granular security concerns for computer rooms and areas hosting information systems assets at individual installation sites.  Therefore the local organization(s) should still document specific protection measures covering SIPRNet and/or NIPRNet assets in a local PSP or in an SSP.    

2.  Ensure security requirements of the computer room(s) (SIPRNet and/or NIPRNet) and collateral classified open storage areas (as applicable) are addressed and that guidance is provided to counter threats during peacetime, transition to war, and in wartime.
  
3. Ensure the plan also addresses entry/access control procedures for the facility overall and for individual computer rooms/secure rooms or other areas housing network equipment (routers/crypto/switches, etc.). Use of an AECS, guards, lock &amp; key systems, cipher locks, etc. should be specifically and thoroughly addressed in the plan.

4. Ensure that access control procedures cover requirements for various categories of persons expected to access the facility such as employees, visitors, vendors, facility maintenance, and foreign nationals.  

NOTE 2: To be complete the plan should specifically address access control of vendors (i.e., vending machine deliveries), cleaning and food service personnel, cleared versus uncleared visitors, foreign national (FN) visitors, FN employees (OCONUS SOFA, liaison, exchange and REL partners). 
  
5. Finally, ensure the plan addresses security measures and response (Emergency Planning Measures) to include application of Force Protection Conditions, anti-terrorism planning and measures, civil disturbances, natural disasters, crime and any other possible local disruptions of the mission.

Ensure there is a "Holistic" Risk Assessment (RA) for the site that includes consideration of environmental hazards, weather hazards, criminal and terrorist hazards, insider threat hazards and any other threats that could possibly impact the Confidentiality/Integrity/Availability (CIA) of the Information Technology (IT) facility and/or Information System (IS) equipment.

2. Ensure the RA is revalidated/updated at least annually.

3. Ensure the current site commander/director signed the risk assessment in conjunction with or in coordination with the AOs for resident system(s), signifying acceptance of any residual risk.  

NOTE 1: While an AO signed ATO does in fact signify acceptance of risk for specific systems, this alone does not meet the requirement for a formal risk assessment, which is a very specific and separate individual document.                                   

NOTE 2: Conducting a risk analysis is not just a simple paper work drill - or at least it should not be.  Often organizations take a risk analysis template and simply insert their organizations information, local environmental information, etc. - but do not do a good job of actually assessing threats, countermeasures in place (or that can be applied) to come up with an acceptable level of residual risk.  A good risk assessment is a team effort (security, IA, COOP, engineers, safety, management...) and should be headed by someone with at least some training in conducting risk assessments.  

NOTE 3: Training is offered by the Defense Security Service (DSS) Academy in Linthicum, MD among others.  

NOTE 4:  The NIST SP 800-30, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments provides a widely used format and instructions for conducting a RA.  Reviewers should recommend sites use this publication as the basis for conducting their RA.

NOTE 5:  When there is a government/DoD contract with an industry partner; the government sponsor is inherently and ultimately responsible for risk based decisions.  The contractor only performs mission related tasks IAW contract specifications (e.g., statement of work (SOW)), which should ideally include guidance for risk assessment and acceptance.  

Hence, while the industry partner can prepare and coordinate the risk assessment it is the government/DoD customer who has the ultimate responsibility for accepting and coordinating risk based on their mission requirements. Therefore, the head of the contract sponsoring organization must approve/sign the risk assessment/acceptance of residual risk.

The Authorizing Official (AO) for industry locations is the Defense Security Service (DSS) Cognizant Security Office (CSO).  Each CSO appoints an AO for system related risk evaluation.  

NOTE 6:  A thorough organizational risk assessment and acceptance of residual risk should be properly coordinated with all stakeholders to ensure there are no conflicts or issues.  This must include the Authorizing Official (AO), and should also include where appropriate the DISN Connection Approval Office (CAO), the Program Management Office (PMO), local law enforcement, fire/safety, Counter Intelligence (CI) Support, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) along with state and local emergency management counterparts as applicable.

The first two fixes are specifically for unclassified DoDIN facilities, while fixes 3 and 4 are for facilities containing SIPRNet assets.  Where both NIPRNet and SIPRNet assets are contained in a facility - the more stringent standards for SIPRNet will be used.

Fixes:

1. Ensure that any facility/building housing unclassified information system assets connected to the DoDIN (such as end-user NIPRNet work stations) has at least one physical barrier supplemented by any type of 24/7 access control (keyed locks, reception, guards, Access Control System, Cipher Locks, etc.).

2. Ensure that unclassified Computer Rooms containing equipment connected to the DoDIN (located within a facility (building, room or area) meeting the standard in #1 above) have an additional layer of physical protection and access control. This fix is intended for rooms with key system assets such as servers, routers, DASD, etc., rather than end user workstations.  

3.  Protection of classified (SIPRNet) assets (such as end user workstations with typical office equipment that are NOT housed and operated within a facility designated as a collateral classified open storage area):

    a.  Ensure that every physical access point to facilities housing DoDIN end-user workstations that process or display classified information is guarded or alarmed 24/7 (minimum of alarm contacts on the doors) and that intrusion alarms are properly monitored.  This is space NOT designated as a collateral classified open storage area.  Normally such space should be controlled/designated as a secret controlled access area (CAA) for SIPRNet.

    b.  Ensure that two forms of identification are required to gain access to a facility housing DoDIN workstations that process or display classified information (e.g., key card with PIN/biometrics or two acceptable forms of picture ID presented to a guard or receptionist). 

    c.  Ensure that a visitor log is maintained for facilities containing DoDIN end-user workstations that process or display classified information. Automated Entry Control System (AECS) log entries may be used to meet this requirement.

NOTE:  Physical access points to facilities housing DoDIN workstations in secret CAAs that process or display classified information, which are located on an access controlled military installation (or that employ another layer of physical barrier/access control) are not required to have an IDS alarm contact on the doors and need only one level of access control.  For instance access control to the facility using only a swipe or proximity card (w/o PIN or biometrics) or a guard checking a single picture ID is acceptable.

4.  Where there are Information System assets stored in secure rooms (AKA: collateral classified open storage areas) that are connected to the SIPRNet - ensure that the senior agency official has determined in writing that security-in-depth exists. 

*Note that the SAO for the Defense Security Service (DSS)/industry is the Cognizant Security Agency (CSA)/Cognizant Security Office (CSO).</fixtext><fix id="F-49253r770262_fix" /><check system="C-49298r770261_chk"><check-content-ref href="Traditional_Security_Checklist_None.xml" name="M" /><check-content>Background Information:  This set of checks is intended to validate security-in-depth protection measures in place for facilities with either Unclassified DoDIN assets (NIPRNet) or Classified (SIPRNet) DoDIN assets or both.  Checks are specifically oriented to each (one or more) of the following 4-situations:

1.  Protection of unclassified (NIPRNet) assets (such as-end user workstations with typical office equipment - PC/laptop/thin client/multi-functional devices (MFD), printers, copiers, scanners, facsimile machine...) that are housed and operated in administrative office spaces.

2.  Protection of unclassified (NIPRNet) assets housed and operated in unclassified computer rooms.  This check is intended for rooms with key system assets such as servers, routers, DASD, etc., rather than end user workstations.  This high level system equipment requires an additional layer of physical protection and access control.

3.  Protection of classified (SIPRNet) assets (such as end-user workstations with typical office equipment - PC/laptop/thin client/multi-functional devices (MFD), printers, copiers, scanners, facsimile machine...) that are housed and operated in administrative office spaces NOT designated for collateral classified open storage (AKA: secure room or closed storage area).  Normally such space should be controlled/designated as secret controlled access areas (CAA) for SIPRNet.

4.  Protection of classified (SIPRNet) assets housed and operated in space designated for collateral classified open storage (AKA: secure room or closed storage area).  Assets in this situation may include both end-user workstations with typical office equipment as detailed above and/or Computer Rooms containing key system assets such as servers, routers, DASD, etc.  So to restate, this includes any classified equipment (both end-user and key system equipment) stored and operated in space designated for and meeting collateral classified open storage standards.
Where both NIPRNet and SIPRNet assets as well as end-user and system level assets are co-located in a facility - the most stringent SID standards applicable for the area will be used.

Checks:

1. Protection of areas containing unclassified (NIPRNet) assets (such as end user workstations):
Check that any facility (building, room or area) housing  unclassified information system assets connected to the DODIN (such as end user NIPRNet work stations) has at least one physical barrier supplemented by any type of 24/7 access control (keyed locks, reception, guards, Access Control System, Cipher Locks, etc.).

2.  Protection of unclassified (NIPRNet) assets housed and operated in unclassified computer rooms:

Check to ensure that Unclassified Computer Rooms containing equipment connected to the DoDIN (located within a facility (building, room or area) meeting the standard in #1 above) have an additional layer of physical protection and access control (beyond that for the surrounding facility or area). This check is intended for rooms with key system assets such as servers, routers, etc., rather than end user workstations.  

3.  Protection of classified (SIPRNet) assets (such as end user workstations with typical office equipment that are NOT housed and operated within a facility designated as a collateral classified open storage area):

    a.  Check to ensure that every physical access point to facilities housing DoDIN end-user workstations that process or display classified information is guarded or alarmed 24/7 (minimum of alarm contacts on the doors) and that intrusion alarms are properly monitored.  This is space NOT designated as a collateral classified open storage area.  Normally such space should be access controlled/designated as a secret controlled access area (CAA) for SIPRNet.

    b.  Check that two forms of identification are required to gain access to a facility housing DoDIN workstations that process or display classified information (e.g., key card with PIN/biometrics or two acceptable forms of picture ID presented to a guard or receptionist).
 
    c.  Check to ensure that a visitor log is maintained for facilities containing DoDIN end-user workstations that process or display classified information. Automated Entry Control System (AECS) log entries may be used to meet this requirement.

NOTE:  Physical access points to facilities housing DoDIN workstations in secret CAAs that process or display classified information, which are located on an access controlled military installation (or that employ another layer of physical barrier/access control) are not required to have an IDS alarm contact on the doors and need only one level of access control.  For instance access control to the facility using only a swipe or proximity card (w/o PIN or biometrics) or a guard checking a single picture ID is acceptable.

4.  Protection of classified (SIPRNet) assets housed and operated in space designated for collateral classified open storage (AKA: secure room or closed storage area):

*Check to ensure that the senior agency official (SAO) has determined in writing that security-in-depth (SID) exists.

Note that the SAO for the Defense Security Service (DSS)/industry is the Cognizant Security Agency (CSA)/Cognizant Security Office (CSO).

SID Explained:
 
SID is a determination that the security program consists of layered and complementary security controls sufficient to deter and detect unauthorized entry and movement within the facility. Examples include, but are not limited to, use of perimeter fences, employee and visitor access controls, use of an IDS, random guard patrols throughout the facility during non-working hours, closed circuit video monitoring or other safeguards that mitigate the vulnerability of open storage areas without alarms as well as for security containers (safes) during non-working hours.
  
Specific Secure Room security standards are not covered under this check for security-in-depth as they are covered in other Rules within this STIG. 
 
Selection of supplementary controls for secure rooms (IDS versus 4-hours guard checks) is based upon the SID in conjunction with an assessment of risk that is accepted by the SAO.
  
Access control requirements for collateral open storage areas are established and must be IAW the DoD Manual 5200.01, V3 and as implemented by Rules in this STIG.

An SID determination may be rendered using one of two methods:
  
First, the SAO can issue SID approvals on a case-by-case basis.  For instance the facility or organization with collateral open storage space would provide the SAO with a request for SID (IAW pre-established organizational (CC/S/A) procedures) that is subsequently approved or disapproved by the SAO.
  
A second method would be for the CC/S/A to establish a policy (Manual, Instruction, Regulation, Circular, etc.) that provides specific criteria or requirements that when met by organizations is evidence of adequate SID for collateral open storage spaces.  Criteria may be based on additional considerations such threat environments (high, medium, or low), if the space is on access controlled installations versus off-installations in public accessible space, CONUS versus OCONUS sites or other such considerations per the discretion of the SAO of the CC/S/A.
  
Regardless of the method used by the SAO to render an SID determination, it must be properly documented and clearly apply to the collateral open storage area (AKA: secure room or closed storage area) being evaluated.

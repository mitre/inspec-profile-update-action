Operating in the proactive flow instantiation mode, the SDN controller pre-populates forwarding tables to the forwarding devices. 

At times, the SDN controller must function in reactive flow instantiation mode; that is, when a forwarding device receives a packet for a flow not found in its forwarding table, it must send or punt it to the controller to receive forwarding instructions. Upon receiving the punted packet, the controller must determine how to forward the packet, create a rule, and populate a new forwarding table to the forwarding device. High rates of punted packets result in excessive controller CPU and memory utilization.

It routes the encapsulated packets based on the outer IP address header, which has the initiating VTEP as the source IP address and the terminating VTEP as the destination IP address.

Each VXLAN segment is mapped to an IP multicast group in the transport IP network. Hence, VTEPs join IP multicast groups based on VNI membership. This is the method by which VTEPs can discover other VTEPs belonging to the same VXLAN segment. Each VTEP-enabled switch is configured to join the applicable multicast group for each VNI through Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP). The IGMP joins will trigger Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) joins, thereby signaling a multicast distribution tree for each group through the transport network based on the locations of participating VTEPs.
The multicast group is used to transmit broadcast, unknown unicast, and multicast traffic through the IP network for each VXLAN segment, limiting all Layer 2 flooding to those switches that have end systems participating in the same VXLAN segment.

The gateway can also filter the north-south traffic to enforce security policies for communication between the physical and virtual workloads. If the edge gateways deployed as virtual machines are resident on the same host, the host becomes a single point of failure for all communication between the virtual workload and the physical network infrastructure. Deploying the edge gateways across multiple hypervisor hosts eliminates the risk of a single point of failure, thereby ensuring there is always reachability between virtual machines and the physical network infrastructure and reducing the risk of black-holing north-south traffic.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Software Defined Networking (SDN) Policy</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Software Defined Networking (SDN) Policy</dc:subject><dc:identifier>3089</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-000366</ident><fixtext fixref="F-79565r1_fix">Deploy each virtual edge gateway across multiple hypervisor hosts.</fixtext><fix id="F-79565r1_fix" /><check system="C-73253r1_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_SDN_NV_STIG.xml" /><check-content>Review the network virtualization platform topology and the SDN manager to verify that each virtual edge gateway has been deployed across multiple hypervisor hosts.

The gateway establishes routing adjacencies between the virtual routers and physical routers. The gateway can also filter the north-south traffic to enforce security policies for communication between the physical and virtual workloads. 

Implementing the edge gateway in either active/standby or equal-cost multipath (ECMP) mode ensures there is always a virtual router to forward north-south traffic, assuming there is always a routing adjacency with a router in the physical network infrastructure. Having an adjacency with only one physical router creates a single point of failure regardless of the number of links deployed, there would be no connectivity between the virtual and physical workloads if a node failure occurred. Hence, it is imperative that each edge gateway is deployed with connectivity to two physical routers.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Software Defined Networking (SDN) Policy</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Software Defined Networking (SDN) Policy</dc:subject><dc:identifier>3089</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-000366</ident><fixtext fixref="F-79567r1_fix">Configure the virtual edge gateways to have routing adjacencies established with two or more physical routers.</fixtext><fix id="F-79567r1_fix" /><check system="C-73255r1_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_SDN_NV_STIG.xml" /><check-content>Review the network topology diagram for both the physical infrastructure and the network virtualization platform (NVP) to determine if the virtual edge gateways have routing adjacencies with two or more physical routers.

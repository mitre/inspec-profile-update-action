Unlimited concurrent connections to the DBMS could allow a successful denial-of-service (DoS) attack by exhausting connection resources; and a system can also fail or be degraded by an overload of legitimate users. Limiting the number of concurrent sessions per user is helpful in reducing these risks.

This requirement addresses concurrent session control for a single account. It does not address concurrent sessions by a single user via multiple system accounts; and it does not deal with the total number of sessions across all accounts.

The capability to limit the number of concurrent sessions per user must be configured in or added to the DBMS (for example, by use of a logon trigger), when this is technically feasible. Note that it is not sufficient to limit sessions via a web server or application server alone, because legitimate users and adversaries can potentially connect to the DBMS by other means.

The organization will need to define the maximum number of concurrent sessions by account type, by account, or a combination thereof. In deciding on the appropriate number, it is important to consider the work requirements of the various types of users. For example, 2 might be an acceptable limit for general users accessing the database via an application; but 10 might be too few for a database administrator using a database management GUI tool, where each query tab and navigation pane may count as a separate session.

(Sessions may also be referred to as connections or logons, which for the purposes of this requirement are synonyms.)&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Redis Enterprise 6.x</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Redis Enterprise 6.x</dc:subject><dc:identifier>5443</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-000054</ident><fixtext fixref="F-54572r804738_fix">To modify the number of maximum sessions, run the following command:

A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential oversight or other error. Managing accounts for the same person in multiple places is inefficient and prone to problems with consistency and synchronization.

A comprehensive application account management process that includes automation helps to ensure that accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed. 

Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to act on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended, or terminated, or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores, such as multiple servers. Account management functions can also include assignment of group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging to notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephone notification to report atypical system account usage.

The DBMS must be configured to automatically use organization-level account management functions, and these functions must immediately enforce the organization's current account policy. 

Automation may be comprised of differing technologies that when placed together contain an overall mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management requirements.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Redis Enterprise 6.x</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Redis Enterprise 6.x</dc:subject><dc:identifier>5443</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-000015</ident><fixtext fixref="F-54573r804741_fix">Integrate Redis Enterprise with LDAP to provide organization-level authentication/access mechanism and account management for all users, groups, roles, and any other principals.

To enable LDAP:
1. Import the saslauthd configuration.
2. Restart saslauthd service.
3. Configure LDAP users.

Configuring LDAP:
To provide the LDAP configuration information:
1. Edit the configuration file located at /etc/opt/redislabs/saslauthd.conf or the installation directory used during initial configuration.

2. Provide the following information associated with each variable:
- ldap_servers: the ldap servers that authenticate against and the port to use:
Port 389 is standardly used for unencrypted LDAP connections
Port 636 is standardly used for encrypted LDAP connections and is strongly recommended.
- Ldap_tls_cacert_file (optional): The path to the CA Certificates. This is required for encrypted LDAP connections only.
- ldap_filter: the filter used to search for users.
- ldap_bind_dn: The distinguished name for the user that will be used to authenticate to the LDAP server.
- ldap_password: The password used for the user specified in ldap_bind_dn

3. Import the saslauthd configuration into Redis Enterprise using the command below, which will distribute the configuration to all nodes in the cluster:
rladmin cluster config saslauthd_ldap_conf &lt;path_to_saslauthd.conf&gt;

Note: For this command to work on a new server installation, a cluster must be set up already.

To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DoD-approved PKIs, all DoD systems, including databases, must be properly configured to implement access control policies. 

Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. 

Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system. 

This requirement is applicable to access control enforcement applications, a category that includes database management systems. If the DBMS does not follow applicable policy when approving access, it may be in conflict with networks or other applications in the information system. This may result in users either gaining or being denied access inappropriately and in conflict with applicable policy.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Redis Enterprise 6.x</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Redis Enterprise 6.x</dc:subject><dc:identifier>5443</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-000213</ident><fixtext fixref="F-54574r804744_fix">To modify the commands or keys a user is able to access, perform the following steps:

Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object or via specified ownership assignment. DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes user-controlled table permissions.

When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or objects. 

A subject that is constrained in its operation by Mandatory Access Control policies is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this requirement. Thus, while Mandatory Access Control imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity level, this requirement permits the subject to pass the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level.

Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object or via specified ownership assignment. DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes user-controlled table permissions.

When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or objects. 

A subject that is constrained in its operation by Mandatory Access Control policies is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this requirement. Thus, while Mandatory Access Control imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity level, this requirement permits the subject to pass the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level.

System documentation should include a definition of the functionality considered privileged.

Depending on circumstances, privileged functions can include, for example, establishing accounts, performing system integrity checks, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals that do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users.

A privileged function in the DBMS/database context is any operation that modifies the structure of the database, its built-in logic, or its security settings. This would include all Data Definition Language (DDL) statements and all security-related statements. In an SQL environment, it encompasses, but is not necessarily limited to: 
CREATE
ALTER
DROP
GRANT
REVOKE
DENY

There may also be Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements that, subject to context, should be regarded as privileged. Possible examples include:
TRUNCATE TABLE;
DELETE, or
DELETE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or
DELETE without a WHERE clause;

UPDATE or
UPDATE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or
UPDATE without a WHERE clause;

any SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE to an application-defined security table executed by other than a security principal.

Depending on the capabilities of the DBMS and the design of the database and associated applications, the prevention of unauthorized use of privileged functions may be achieved by means of DBMS security features, database triggers, other mechanisms, or a combination of these.

Redis Enterprise comes with a configurable role-based access control mechanism that allows users to be given specific roles.

Privilege elevation must be used only where necessary and protected from misuse.

This calls for inspection of application source code, which will require collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers, and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored. At a minimum, the DBA must attempt to obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue has been addressed and must document what has been discovered.

Audit records can be generated from various components within the DBMS (e.g., process, module). Certain specific application functionalities may be audited as well. The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is capable of generating audit records.

DoD has defined the list of events for which the DBMS will provide an audit record generation capability as the following: 

(i) Successful and unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete privileges, security objects, security levels, or categories of information (e.g., classification levels);

(ii) Access actions, such as successful and unsuccessful login attempts, privileged activities, or other system-level access, starting and ending time for user access to the system, concurrent logins from different workstations, successful and unsuccessful accesses to objects, all program initiations, and all direct access to the information system; and

(iii) All account creation, modification, disabling, and termination actions.

- rlutil dmc_reconf bdb=&lt;db_id&gt; 

Logging levels include:
1. Debug (DBG) - at this level, anything goes, to include whatever a developer finds useful for debugging. This level should very rarely be active in production and is intended for developers only.

2. Trace (TRC) - used for tracking specific elements' lifespan, issues a few messages (only those important for tracing element) per flow. It might be used in production, under very restrictive and careful watch, for very short periods of time.

3. Info (INF) - positive events changing the behavior of app or one of its major elements: a key component started, configuration changed, etc.

4. Warn (WRN) - events that have temporary (usually recoverable) negative impact on one or more major application elements (server went down, a temporary lack or resources, etc.), such events lead to undesired impact on many sub-elements, while others can still function properly.

5. Error (ERR) - unexpected, harmful events - a key element/component cannot function properly, there is no way to recover proper functionality until this situation is resolved (configuration in accessible, or fundamentally broken, network unreachable, etc.).

6. Fatal (FTL) - unrecoverable state. Usually, the last message (or one of very few of them) in an app's lifetime.

/etc/rsyslog.d/redislabs.conf

The log entries can be categorized into events and alerts. Events are only logged, while alerts have a state attached to them. RS log entries include information about the specific event that occurred. In addition, rsyslog can be configured to add other information, like the event severity, for example.

Since rsyslog entries do not include the severity information by default, use the following instructions to log that information (in Ubuntu): 

Add the following line to /etc/rsyslog.conf $template TraditionalFormatWithPRI,"%pri-text%:%timegenerated%:%HOSTNAME%:%syslogtag%:%msg:::drop-last-lf%\n"

And modify $ActionFileDefaultTemplate to use the new template: $ActionFileDefaultTemplateTraditionalFormatWithPRI

Save the changes and restart rsyslog for the changes to take effect. The alerts and events may be found under /var/log in messages log file.

Command components:
%pri­text% ­adds the severity
%timegenerated% ­adds the timestamp
%HOSTNAME% ­adds the machine name
%syslogtag% ­the RS message as detailed below in the Log entry structure section below.
%msg:::drop­last­lf%n ­ removes duplicated log entries

Example configuration:
template(name="RedisLabsEventTemplate" type="string" string="%syslogseverity-text%:%pri-text%:%timegenerated%:%HOSTNAME%:%syslogtag%:%msg:::drop-last-lf% -- %syslogtag%  -- %programname% \n")

if $programname startswith 'event_log' then {
  action(type="omfile" file="/var/log/redislabs.log" template="RedisLabsEventTemplate" )
}

With this configuration, the syslog service will:
Load a new template named RedisLabsEventTemplate that logs the message with the priority (syslogseverity-text) that will be info, crit, warning, etc. 

Use this template to write into the file /var/log/redislabs.log when the program is "event_log" (the Redis Enterprise log manager). Learn more about the template syntax in the syslog documentation. 

Restart syslog: systemctl restart rsyslog

Testing the new configuration:

The task of allocating audit record storage capacity is usually performed during initial installation of the DBMS and is closely associated with the DBA and system administrator roles. The DBA or system administrator will usually coordinate the allocation of physical drive space with the application owner/installer and the application will prompt the installer to provide the capacity information, the physical location of the disk, or both.

In determining the capacity requirements, consider such factors as: total number of users; expected number of concurrent users during busy periods; number and type of events being monitored; types and amounts of data being captured; the frequency/speed with which audit records are offloaded to the central log management system; and any limitations that exist on the DBMS's ability to reuse the space formerly occupied by offloaded records.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Redis Enterprise 6.x</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Redis Enterprise 6.x</dc:subject><dc:identifier>5443</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-001849</ident><fixtext fixref="F-54584r855601_fix">Ensure that the server is configured with enough storage space to accommodate database and audit record storage.

Audit processing failures include software/hardware errors; failures in the audit capturing mechanisms; and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded. Responses to audit failure depend upon the nature of the failure mode. 

When availability is an overriding concern, approved actions in response to an audit failure are as follows: 

(i) If the failure was caused by the lack of audit record storage capacity, the DBMS must continue generating audit records, if possible (automatically restarting the audit service if necessary), overwriting the oldest audit records in a first-in-first-out manner.

(ii) If audit records are sent to a centralized collection server and communication with this server is lost or the server fails, the DBMS must queue audit records locally until communication is restored or until the audit records are retrieved manually. Upon restoration of the connection to the centralized collection server, action should be taken to synchronize the local audit data with the collection server.

Systems where availability is paramount will most likely be MAC I; the final determination is the prerogative of the application owner, subject to Authorizing Official concurrence. In any case, sufficient auditing resources must be allocated to avoid audit data loss in all but the most extreme situations.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Redis Enterprise 6.x</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Redis Enterprise 6.x</dc:subject><dc:identifier>5443</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-000140</ident><fixtext fixref="F-54589r804789_fix">Redis Enterprise uses the default logrotate daemon to schedule rotation of logs stored on the operating system.

Without reauthentication, users may access resources or perform tasks for which they do not have authorization. 

When applications provide the capability to change security roles or escalate the functional capability of the application, it is critical the user reauthenticate.

In addition to the reauthentication requirements associated with session locks, organizations may require reauthentication of individuals and/or devices in other situations, including (but not limited to) the following circumstances:

(i) When authenticators change; 
(ii) When roles change; 
(iii) When security categories of information systems change; 
(iv) When the execution of privileged functions occurs; 
(v) After a fixed period of time; or
(vi) Periodically.

Within the DoD, the minimum circumstances requiring reauthentication are privilege escalation and role changes.

If any exist, confirm they are properly documented.

Configure Redis Enterprise settings to meet organizationally defined requirements:
User account security 

To ensure user accounts are secured and not misused, RS supports enforcement of:
- Password complexity
- Password expiration
- Account lock on failed attempts
- Account inactivity timeout

To enforce a more advanced password policy that meets the desired contractual and compliance requirements and associated organizational policies, it is recommend to use LDAP integration with an external identity provider, such as Active Directory.

Resetting user passwords: 
To reset a user password from the CLI, run:
rladmin cluster reset_password &lt;username&gt;

The user is asked to enter and confirm the new password.

Setting up local password complexity:
RS allows for enforcement of a password complexity profile that meets most organizational needs. The password complexity profile is defined by:
- At least 8 characters
- At least one uppercase character
- At least one lowercase character
- At least one number (not first or last character)
- At least one special character (not first or last character)
- Does not contain the User ID or reverse of the User ID
- No more than three repeating characters
Note: The password complexity profile applies to when a new user is added or an existing user changes their password.

To enforce the password complexity profile, run:
curl -k -X PUT -v -H "cache-control: no-cache" -H "content-type: application/json" -u "&lt;administrator-user-email&gt;:&lt;password&gt;" -d '{"password_complexity":true}' https://&lt;RS_server_address&gt;:9443/v1/cluster

Setting local user password expiration: 
RS allows for enforced password expiration to meet compliance and contractual requirements. To enforce an expiration of a local user password after a specified number of days, run:
curl -k -X PUT -v -H "cache-control: no-cache" -H "content-type: application/json" -u "&lt;administrator_user&gt;:&lt;password&gt;" -d '{"password_expiration_duration":&lt;number_of_days&gt;}' https://&lt;RS_server_address&gt;:9443/v1/cluster
To disable password expiration, set the number of days to 0.

Account lock on failed attempts: 
To prevent unauthorized access to RS, organizations may enforce account lockout after a specified number of failed login attempts.

Session timeout: 
When logging in to the web UI, the account is automatically logged out after 15 minutes of inactivity.

To change the duration of inactivity that causes the timeout:
From rladmin, run: rladmin cluster config cm_session_timeout_minutes &lt;minutes&gt;

From the REST API, run:
curl --request PUT \
  --url https://localhost:9443/v1/cluster \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{
"cm_session_timeout_minutes": &lt;minutes&gt;

A certificate's certification path is the path from the end entity certificate to a trusted root certification authority (CA). Certification path validation is necessary for a relying party to make an informed decision regarding acceptance of an end entity certificate. Certification path validation includes checks such as certificate issuer trust, time validity, and revocation status for each certificate in the certification path. Revocation status information for CA and subject certificates in a certification path is commonly provided via certificate revocation lists (CRLs) or online certificate status protocol (OCSP) responses.

Database Management Systems that do not validate certificates by performing RFC 5280-compliant certification path validation are in danger of accepting certificates that are invalid and/or counterfeit. This could allow unauthorized access to the database.

1. Replace the RS server default certificates and key on all nodes with the CA-signed certificate and restart the proxy.

To replace certificates using the rladmin CLI, run:
rladmin cluster certificate set &lt;cert-name&gt; certificate_file &lt;cert-file-name&gt;.pem key_file &lt;key-file-name&gt;.pem
Where:
cert-name - The certificate name to replace:
For management UI: cm
For REST API: api
For database endpoint: proxy
For syncer: syncer
For metrics exporter: metrics_exporter
cert-file-name - The name of the certificate file
key-file-name - The name of the key file

Note: A certificate for the databases' endpoint should be assigned for the same domain as the cluster name. For example, for a cluster with the name "redislabs.com" the certificate should be for "*.redislabs.com".

2. Add the TLS client certificates in the UI including CA certificates and any intermediate certificates by chaining the certificate into one file (can use a cat command to chain the certificates).

3.

Normally, with PKI authentication, the interaction with the user for authentication will be handled by a software component separate from the DBMS, such as ActivID ActivClient. However, in cases where the DBMS controls the interaction, this requirement applies.

To prevent the compromise of authentication information such as passwords and PINs during the authentication process, the feedback from the system must not provide any information that would allow an unauthorized user to compromise the authentication mechanism. 

Obfuscation of user-provided authentication secrets when typed into the system is a method used in addressing this risk. 

Displaying asterisks when a user types in a password or a smart card PIN is an example of obscuring feedback of authentication secrets.

# sudo fips-mode-setup --enable

Modify the kernel command line of the current kernel in the "grub.cfg" file by adding the following option to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX key in the "/etc/default/grub" file and then rebuild the "grub.cfg" file:

Changes to "/etc/default/grub" require rebuilding the "grub.cfg" file as follows:

On BIOS-based machines, use the following command:
# sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

On UEFI-based machines, use the following command:
# sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg

If /boot or /boot/efi reside on separate partitions, the kernel parameter "boot=&lt;partition of /boot or /boot/efi&gt;" must be added to the kernel command line. Identify a partition by running the df /boot or df /boot/efi command:
# sudo df /boot

If configured, Redis Enterprise Software (RS) can use industry-standard encryption to protect the data in transit between a Redis client and RS. For this purpose, RS uses transport layer security (TLS) protocol, which is the more secure successor to SSL.

To enable TLS, the RS cluster nodes, the database, and  client must be configured as detailed below.

Configuration of the RS nodes:
By default, each cluster node has a different set of self-signed certificates. These certificates can be replaced with another certificate, preferably a certificate issued by an intermediate certificate authority (CA).

Configuration of the database:
To encrypt the connection to the database endpoint with TLS, enter the contents the client certificate to the TLS field.
Note: Once TLS encryption is enabled for the database endpoint, the database does not accept unsecured connections. TLS encryption can significantly impact database throughput and latency.

Adding TLS CA signed certificates to the proxy:
The proxy is responsible for terminating the TLS connection.
Server certificate and key are located on /etc/opt/redislabs:proxy_cert.pem - server certificate thatproxy_key.pem - server certificate key*any update on these requires a proxy restart

Enabling of TLS is done via "ssl authentication" field in the UI. It is a requirement to add a client-side certificate as a TLS connection is done via client certificate authentication (not just server-side authentication).

Installing CA signed certificates high-level steps: 
1. Replace the RS server certificates and key on all nodes with the CA signed certificate and restart the proxy.
Note: A certificate for the databases' endpoint should be assigned for the same domain as the cluster name. For example, for a cluster with the name "redislabs.com" the certificate should be for "*.redislabs.com".

2. Add the TLS client certificates in the UI including CA certificates and any intermediate certificates by chaining the certificate into one file (use a cat command to chain the certificates).

3. On the client side, import and trust the CA and intermediate certificates (chain the CA certificate with intermediate as one file to use and import).

Client configuration:
To connect to a database configured with TLS encryption, either use one of the Redis clients that inherently support SSL encryption, or use any Redis client and create a secured tunnel between the client machine and the RS nodes.

To create a secure tunnel between the client machine and the RS nodes, use tools that enable this functionality, such as spiped or stunnel. An example of how to use stunnel is detailed below.

Note: For security reasons, RS supports only the TLS protocol. Therefore, make sure the Redis client or secured tunnel solution used supports TLS, preferably TLS v1.2.

When using self-signed certificates on the cluster nodes, make sure to copy these certificates to the client machines as well, thereby enabling the client to validate the cluster nodes.

When using a certificate issued by an intermediate certificate authority (CA) on the cluster nodes, make sure that the CA root certificate is installed on the client machines.

Example how to secure client connection with TLS using stunnel: 
The instructions below explain how to use stunnel for setting up a secure tunnel between a client machine and the RS nodes when the client is running on Ubuntu, using the default RS nodes' self-signed certificates, and a self-signed certificate on the client machine.

1. Install stunnel version 5 or higher on the client machine. Older versions of stunnel do not support the TLS protocol.

2. Create a self-signed certificate on the client machine.  

3. Generate a private key by running the following commands:
sudo su
openssl genrsa -out /etc/stunnel/keyclient.pem 4096

4. Generate a client certificate by running the following commands:
openssl req -new -x509 -key /etc/stunnel/keyclient.pem
-out
/etc/stunnel/cert.pem -days 1826

5. When prompted, enter the appropriate configuration details for the certificate.

6. Copy the RS node certificates from all nodes to the client machine. The certificates are saved in a file named proxy_cert.pem, which is stored in /etc/opt/redislabs in each node.

7. Rename the certificate files fetched from the RS nodes as certsvr.pem. For example: certsvr1.pem, certsvr2.pem.

8. Create a single file for all of the server certificates on the client machine, by running the following command from the OS CLI. For example:
cat /etc/stunnel/certsvr1.pem /etc/stunnel/certsvr2.pem &gt; /etc/stunnel/servercerts.pem

9. Configure stunnel for the connection to RS by using the steps below:

10. Create a redislabs.conf file in /etc/stunnel folder.

11. Make sure the certificates that have been generated exist in the following folder: /etc/stunnel.

12. Edit the redislabs.conf content to look as follows: 
cert = /etc/stunnel/cert.pem key = /etc/stunnel/keyclient.pem cafile = /etc/stunnel/servercerts.pem verify = 2 delay = yes output = /tmp/stunnel.log pid = /tmp/stunnel.pid[redislabs] client = yes accept = [server IP address]:[configured port] connect = [database endpoint value]
Where [database endpoint value] is the database endpoint as can be retrieved from RS.

Note: The value for the accept parameter is the local IP and port that is used for redirecting the traffic through the secure tunnel to the database endpoint configured in the connect parameter.

13. Copy the contents of the client certificate from cert.pem and enter them in the SSL Client Authentication field, in the RS UI, of the database to be secured. When done, be sure to save the change.

14. Start the stunnel service by running the following command: service stunnel restart

Note: Any change made to the stunnel configuration requires restarting the stunnel service.

15. Check the stunnel log file to verify that the connection is working properly. The log file is created under the root folder within the configuration mentioned above.

16. Test the connection to the Redis database from the client machine. Use Redis-cli to run commands on the client machine, and the commands are redirected from the local machine's port [configured port] to the RS database endpoint. Note the connection to the Redis database is done through the local port; do not try to connect directly to the database endpoint.

TLS version information: 
To set the minimum TLS version that can be used for encrypting the data in transit between a Redis client and a Redis Enterprise cluster, use the REST API or the following rladmin command:
rladmin&gt; cluster config min_data_TLS_version [version, e.g., 1.2]

Databases must fail to a known consistent state. Transactions must be successfully completed or rolled back.

All data is stored and managed exclusively in either RAM or RAM + Flash Memory (Redis on Flash) and therefore, is at risk of being lost upon a process or server failure. As Redis Enterprise Software is not just a caching solution, but also a full-fledged database, persistence to disk is critical. Therefore, Redis Enterprise Software supports persisting data to disk on a per-database basis.

Append Only File (AOF) is a continuous writing of data to disk Snapshot. It is not a replacement for backups but should be done in addition to backups. 

AOF writes the latest "write" commands into a file either every second or during every write. It resembles a traditional RDBMS's redo log. This file can later be replayed to recover from a crash.

To ensure data availability, Redis Enterprise Software must be implemented in, at a minimum, a three-node cluster. A three-node cluster can withstand one node failure without data loss. If more than one node is lost in a three-node cluster and persistence is not enabled, then data loss is to be expected.

The Append Only File is a persistence mode that provides much better durability. For instance, using the default data fsync policy, Redis can lose just one second of writes in a dramatic event like a server power outage, or a single write if something goes wrong with the Redis process itself, but the operating system is still running correctly. AOF and RDB persistence can be enabled at the same time without problems. If the AOF is enabled on startup Redis will load the AOF, that is the file with the better durability guarantees. Check http://redis.io/topics/persistence for more information.

Redis Labs additionally recommends using the wait command.

Failure to a known secure state helps prevent a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability in the event of a failure of the information system or a component of the system.

Preserving information system state information helps to facilitate system restart and return to the operational mode of the organization with less disruption of mission/business processes.

Since it is usually not possible to test this capability in a production environment, systems should either be validated in a testing environment or prior to installation. This requirement is usually a function of the design of the IDPS component. Compliance can be verified by acceptance/validation processes or vendor attestation.

If configured, Redis Enterprise Software (RS) can use industry-standard encryption to protect the data in transit between a Redis client and RS. For this purpose, RS uses transport layer security (TLS) protocol, which is the more secure successor to SSL.

To enable TLS, the RS cluster nodes, the database, and client must be configured as detailed below.

Configuration of the RS nodes:
By default, each cluster node has a different set of self-signed certificates. These certificates can be replaced with another certificate, preferably a certificate issued by an intermediate certificate authority (CA).

Configuration of the database:
To encrypt the connection to the database endpoint with TLS, enter the contents the client certificate to the TLS field.
Note: Once TLS encryption is enabled for the database endpoint, the database does not accept unsecured connections. TLS encryption can significantly impact database throughput and latency.

Adding TLS CA signed certificates to the proxy:
The proxy is responsible for terminating the TLS connection.
Server certificate and key are located on /etc/opt/redislabs:proxy_cert.pem - server certificate thatproxy_key.pem - server certificate key*any update on these requires a proxy restart

Enabling of TLS is done via the "ssl authentication" field in the UI. It is a requirement to add a client-side certificate as a TLS connection via client certificate authentication (not just server-side authentication).

Installing CA signed certificates:
Replace the RS server certificates and key on all nodes with the CA signed certificate and restart the proxy.
Note: A certificate for the databases' endpoint should be assigned for the same domain as the cluster name. For example, for a cluster with the name "redislabs.com" the certificate should be for "*.redislabs.com".

Add the TLS client certificates in the UI including CA certificates and any intermediate certificates by chaining the certificate into one file (use a cat command to chain the certificates).
On the client side make sure to import and trust the CA and intermediate certificates (chain the CA certificate with intermediate as one file to use and import).

Client configuration:
To connect to a database configured with TLS encryption, either use one of the Redis clients that inherently support SSL encryption, or use any Redis client and create a secured tunnel between the client machine and the RS nodes.

To create a secure tunnel between the client machine and the RS nodes, use tools that enable this functionality, such as spiped or stunnel. An example of how to use stunnel is detailed below.
Note: For security reasons, RS supports only the TLS protocol. Therefore, make sure that the Redis client or secured tunnel solution used supports TLS, preferably TLS v1.2.

When using self-signed certificates on the cluster nodes, make sure to copy these certificates to the client machines as well, thereby enabling the client to validate the cluster nodes.

When using a certificate issued by an intermediate certificate authority (CA) on the cluster nodes, make sure that the CA root certificate is installed on the client machines.

Example of how to secure client connection with TLS using stunnel: 
The instructions below explain how to use stunnel for setting up a secure tunnel between a client machine and the RS nodes when the client is running on Ubuntu, using the default RS nodes' self-signed certificates, and a self-signed certificate on the client machine.

1. Install stunnel version 5 or higher on the client machine. Older versions of stunnel do not support the TLS protocol.

2. Create a self-signed certificate on the client machine:

3. Generate a private key by running the following commands:
sudo su
openssl genrsa -out /etc/stunnel/keyclient.pem 4096

4. Generate a client certificate by running the following commands:
openssl req -new -x509 -key /etc/stunnel/keyclient.pem
-out
/etc/stunnel/cert.pem -days 1826

5. When prompted, enter the appropriate configuration details for the certificate.

6. Copy the RS node certificates from all nodes to the client machine. The certificates are saved in a file named proxy_cert.pem, which is stored in /etc/opt/redislabs in each node.

7. Rename the certificate files fetched from the RS nodes as certsvr.pem. For example: certsvr1.pem, certsvr2.pem.

8. Create a single file for all of the server certificates on the client machine by running the following command from the OS CLI. For example: cat /etc/stunnel/certsvr1.pem /etc/stunnel/certsvr2.pem &gt; /etc/stunnel/servercerts.pem

9. Configure stunnel for the connection to RS by using the steps below:

10. Create a redislabs.conf file in /etc/stunnel folder.

11. Make sure that the certificates that have been generated exist in the following folder: /etc/stunnel.

12. Edit the redislabs.conf content to look as follows:cert = /etc/stunnel/cert.pem key = /etc/stunnel/keyclient.pem cafile = /etc/stunnel/servercerts.pem verify = 2 delay = yes output = /tmp/stunnel.log pid = /tmp/stunnel.pid[redislabs] client = yes accept = [server IP address]:[configured port] connect = [database endpoint value] Where [database endpoint value] is the database endpoint as can be retrieved from RS.

Note: The value for the accept parameter is the local IP and port that is used for redirecting the traffic through the secure tunnel to the database endpoint configured in the connect parameter.

13. Copy the contents of the client certificate from cert.pem and enter them in the SSL Client Authentication field, in the RS UI, of the database to be secured. When done, be sure to save the change.

14. Start the stunnel service by running the following command: service stunnel restart

Note: Any change made to the stunnel configuration requires restarting the stunnel service.

15. Check the stunnel log file to verify that the connection is working properly. The log file is created under the root folder within the configuration mentioned above.

16. Test the connection to the Redis database from the client machine. Use redis-cli to run commands on the client machine, and the commands are redirected from the local machine's port [configured port] to the RS database endpoint. Note that the connection to the Redis database is done through the local port; do not try to connect directly to the database endpoint.

TLS version information:
To set the minimum TLS version that can be used for encrypting the data in transit between a Redis client and a Redis Enterprise cluster, use the REST API or the following rladmin command:
rladmin&gt; cluster config min_data_TLS_version [version, e.g., 1.2]

It takes advantage of the dynamic execution capabilities of various programming languages, including dialects of LUA and SQL. In such cases, the attacker deduces the manner in which code is processed, either from inside knowledge or by observing system behavior in response to invalid inputs. When the attacker identifies scenarios where code is executed dynamically, the attacker is then able to craft input strings that subvert it. Potentially, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to data, including security settings, and severely corrupt or destroy the database.

The principal protection against code injection is not to use dynamic execution except where it provides necessary functionality that cannot be used otherwise. Use strongly typed data items rather than general-purpose strings as input parameters to task-specific, pre-compiled stored procedures and functions (and triggers).

Because Redis does not rely on a query language, there is no known method of SQL injection that would apply to Redis. Redis is a key value store and relies on commands that do not have a unified query language. Redis does have an embedded LUA interpreter and the user will need to disable these.

When dynamic execution is necessary, ways to mitigate the risk include the following, which should be implemented both in the on-screen application and at the database level, in the stored procedures:
- Allow strings as input only when necessary. 
- Rely on data typing to validate numbers, dates, etc. Do not accept invalid values. If substituting other values for them, think carefully about whether this could be subverted.
- Limit the size of input strings to what is truly necessary.
- If single quotes/apostrophes, double quotes, semicolons, equals signs, angle brackets, or square brackets will never be valid as input, reject them.
- If comment markers will never be valid as input, reject them. 
- If HTML and XML tags, entities, comments, etc., will never be valid, reject them.
- If wildcards are present, reject them unless truly necessary. 
- If there are range limits on the values that may be entered, enforce those limits.
- Institute procedures for inspection of programs for correct use of dynamic coding by a party other than the developer.
- Conduct rigorous testing of program modules that use dynamic coding, searching for ways to subvert the intended use.
- Record the inspection and testing in the system documentation.
- Bear in mind that all this applies not only to screen input, but also to the values in an incoming message to a web service or to a stored procedure called by a software component that has not itself been hardened in these ways. Not only can the caller be subject to such vulnerabilities, but it may also itself be the attacker.

This calls for inspection of application source code, which will require collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers, and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored. At a minimum, the DBA must attempt to obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue has been addressed and must document what has been discovered.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Redis Enterprise 6.x</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Redis Enterprise 6.x</dc:subject><dc:identifier>5443</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-001310</ident><fixtext fixref="F-54639r804939_fix">Redis does not rely on a query language and there is no known method of SQL injection that would apply to Redis.

Not only can the caller be subject to such vulnerabilities; it may itself be the attacker.

This calls for inspection of application source code, which will require collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers, and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored. At a minimum, the DBA must attempt to obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue has been addressed and must document what has been discovered.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Redis Enterprise 6.x</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Redis Enterprise 6.x</dc:subject><dc:identifier>5443</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-001310</ident><fixtext fixref="F-54640r804942_fix">Redis does not rely on a query language and there is no known method of SQL injection that would apply to Redis.

Vendors are constantly updating and patching their products to address newly discovered security vulnerabilities. Organizations (including any contractor to the organization) are required to promptly install security-relevant software updates (e.g., patches, service packs, and hot fixes). Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system error handling must also be addressed expeditiously. 

Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software may vary based on a variety of factors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). 

This requirement will apply to software patch management solutions that are used to install patches across the enclave and also to applications themselves that are not part of that patch management solution. For example, many browsers today provide the capability to install their own patch software. Patch criticality, as well as system criticality, will vary. Therefore, the tactical situations regarding the patch management process will also vary. This means that the time period used must be a configurable parameter. Time frames for application of security-relevant software updates may be dependent upon the Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process.

The application will be configured to check for and install security-relevant software updates within an identified time period from the availability of the update. The specific time period will be defined by an authoritative source (e.g., IAVM, CTOs, DTMs, and STIGs).

To upgrade the Redis Enterprise Software (RS) software on a cluster, upgrade each of the nodes and then upgrade each of the databases in the cluster.

- To upgrade the cluster to v6.0, the cluster must first be on 5.4.0 or above and the databases must be running Redis 5.
- To upgrade the cluster to v5.6, the cluster must first be on 5.0.2-30 or above.
- To upgrade the cluster to v5.4, the cluster must first be on 5.0 or above.
- To upgrade the cluster to v5.2, the cluster must first be on 4.5 or above.

The upgrade process for a Redis Enterprise Software cluster is "ongoing" when the nodes in the cluster have mixed versions. The upgrade is only considered complete when all of the nodes are upgraded to the new version.

WARNING Using features from the newer version before all nodes are upgraded can produce unexpected results or cause failures in the cluster.

Upgrading a node: 
Upgrading the software on a node requires installing the RS installation package on all of the machines on which RS is installed.

WARNING: The master node must be upgraded before upgrading the other nodes. It is recommended to keep all nodes up until the upgrade is completed on all nodes. The node role is shown in the output of the rladmin status nodes command. The installation path and user cannot be changed during upgrade. Node upgrade fails if the SSL certificates were configured in version 5.0.2 or above by manually updating the certificates on the disk instead of updating them through the API. For assistance with this issue, contact Support.

Run install.sh from the directory where the media was untarred just like what is done for a new installation. The software recognizes this is an upgrade and proceeds accordingly.

As with a new installation, user must sudo or be root to do the upgrade.

To upgrade a node, run:
sudo ./install.sh

The node upgrade process restarts the services running RS, which causes a short interruption to connections to the proxy, node, and databases.

WARNING: To ensure cluster and databases' availability, it is important to upgrade the nodes one by one, and not attempt to upgrade more than one node at a time. To make sure that the node is functioning properly, run rlcheck and rladmin status extra all on the node both before and after the upgrade.

If the RS management UI is open in the browser while upgrading the nodes, make sure to refresh the browser before trying to work with the UI again.

Upgrading a database 
Some RS upgrades add support for new Redis versions. In these cases, Redis Labs recommends upgrading the databases to the new Redis version, although this is not mandatory because RS upgrades are backward compatible. RS also supports a mix of Redis database versions.

RS always supports two Redis versions. By default, new Redis databases are created with the latest version, and existing databases get upgraded to the latest version according to the instructions detailed below. If there is a desire to change the default Redis version to the previous version supported, it is recommended to use the tune cluster default_redis_version command in the rladmin CLI and set it to the previous Redis version supported.

To determine whether the Redis database versions match the latest Redis version supported by RS:
In the rladmin CLI, run the status command. If the Redis version is not the latest supported, an indication appears in the command output next to the database's status.

In the Management UI, Navigate to the Cluster &gt;&gt; Configuration page. The page lists the latest Redis version supported.

If the Redis database versions are older than the version supported by RS, Redis Labs recommends upgrading the Redis databases.

To upgrade the database:
- Ensure that all of the nodes in the RS cluster are upgraded. Databases cannot be upgraded before all of the nodes in the cluster are upgraded.
- In the rladmin CLI on any node in the cluster, run this command for each database: 
rladmin upgrade db &lt;database_name | database_ID&gt;

During the database upgrade process, the database is restarted. As a result:
For databases that have replication enabled, a failover is done before the master database restarts to make sure that there is no downtime.

For databases without replication but with persistence enabled, the database is unavailable during the restart because data is restored from the persistence file. The length of the downtime is different for each persistence option. For example, AOF usually takes longer than an RDB file.

For databases that have neither replication nor persistence enabled, the database loses all its data after it is restarted.

Upgrading Active-Active databases 
When upgrading an Active-Active (CRDB) database, the following may also be upgraded:

Protocol version - RS 5.4.2 and higher include a new CRDB protocol version to support new Active-Active features. The CRDB protocol is backward-compatible so that RS 5.4.2 CRDB instances can understand write-operations that come from instances with the older CRDB protocol, but CRDB instances with the older protocol cannot understand write-operations of instances with the newer protocol version. As a result, after upgrading the CRDB protocol on one instance, instances that were not upgraded yet cannot receive write updates from the upgraded instance. The upgraded instance receives updates from upgraded and non-upgraded instances.

Note: Upgrade all instances of a specific CRDB within a reasonable time frame to avoid temporary inconsistencies between the instances. Make sure that  all instances of a specific CRDB are upgraded before performing global operations on the CRDB, such as removing instances and adding new instances.

After upgrading an instance to use the new protocol version, it automatically receives any missing write-operations.

Feature set version: RS 5.6.0 and higher include a new feature set version to support new Active-Active features. When updating the feature set version for an Active-Active database, the feature set version is updated for all of the database instances.

To upgrade a CRDB instance:
Upgrade RS on each node in the clusters where the CRDB instances are located.

To confirm the status of the CRDB instances, run: rladmin status

The statuses of the CRDB instances on the node can indicate:
OLD REDIS VERSION
OLD CRDB PROTOCOL VERSION
OLD CRDB FEATURESET VERSION
crdb-upgrade-node

To upgrade each CRDB instance including the Redis version and CRDB protocol version, run:
rladmin upgrade db &lt;database_name | database_ID&gt;

If the protocol version is old, read the warning message carefully and confirm. crdb-upgrade-protocol

The CRDB instance uses the new Redis version and CRDB protocol version.

To upgrade the CRDB instance without upgrading the protocol version:
If the feature set version is old, all of the CRDB instances must be upgraded. Then, to update the feature set for each active-active database, run:
crdb-cli crdb update --crdb-guid &lt;CRDB-GUID&gt; --featureset-version yes

Retrieve the &lt;CRDB-GUID&gt; with the following command:
crdb-cli crdb list

Look for the fully qualified domain name (CLUSTER-FDQN) of the cluster and use the associated GUID.</fixtext><fix id="F-54642r804948_fix" /><check system="C-54688r804947_chk"><check-content-ref href="Redis_Enterprise_6.x_STIG.xml" name="M" /><check-content>To determine the current version of the software, perform the steps below:

1. Import the saslauthd configuration.
2. Restart saslauthd service.
3. Configure LDAP users.

To provide the LDAP configuration information:
1. Edit the configuration file located at /etc/opt/redislabs/saslauthd.conf or the installation directory used during initial configuration.

2. Provide the following information associated with each variable:
ldap_servers: the ldap servers that authenticate against and the port to use
- Port 389 is standardly used for unencrypted LDAP connections.
- Port 636 is standardly used for encrypted LDAP connections and is strongly recommended.
- Ldap_tls_cacert_file: The path to the CA Certificates. This is required for encrypted LDAP connections only.
- ldap_filter: the filter used to search for users.
- ldap_bind_dn: The distinguished name for the user that will be used to authenticate to the LDAP server.
- ldap_password: The password used for the user specified in ldap_bind_dn.

3. Import the saslauthd configuration into Redis Enterprise using the command below, which will distribute the configuration to all nodes in the cluster:
rladmin cluster config saslauthd_ldap_conf &lt;path_to_saslauthd.conf&gt;

Note: For this command to work on a new server installation, a cluster must be set up already.

4. Restart saslauthd:
sudo supervisorctl restart saslauthd

An example configuration for reference may be found below:
ldap_servers: ldaps://ldap1.mydomain.com:636 ldap://ldap2.mydomain.com:636

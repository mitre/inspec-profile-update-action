Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their application session prior to vacating the vicinity, applications need to be able to identify when a user's application session has idled and take action to initiate the session lock.

The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be determined and/or controlled. This is typically at the operating system level and results in a system lock but may be at the application level where the application interface window is secured instead.

Owners of inactive accounts will not notice if unauthorized access to their user account has been obtained. Applications need to track periods of user inactivity and disable accounts after 35 days of inactivity. Such a process greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be hijacked, leading to a data compromise.

To address access requirements, many application developers choose to integrate their applications with enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements. Such integration allows the application developer to offload those access control functions and focus on core application features and functionality.

This policy does not apply to either emergency accounts or infrequently used accounts. Infrequently used accounts are local login administrator accounts used by system administrators when network or normal login/access is not available. Emergency accounts are administrator accounts created in response to crisis situations.

The banner must be acknowledged by the user prior to allowing the user access to the application. This provides assurance that the user has seen the message and accepted the conditions for access. If the consent banner is not acknowledged by the user, DOD will not be in compliance with system use notifications required by law.

To establish acceptance of the application usage policy, a click-through banner at application login is required. The application must prevent further activity until the user executes a positive action to manifest agreement by clicking on a box indicating "OK". System use notifications are required only for access via login interfaces with human users and are not required when such human interfaces do not exist.

The banner must be formatted in accordance with DTM-08-060. Use the following verbiage for applications that can accommodate banners of 1300 characters:

"You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized use only.

-At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.

-Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose.

-This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect USG interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy.

Such communications and work product are private and confidential. See User Agreement for details."

Use the following verbiage for operating systems that have severe limitations on the number of characters that can be displayed in the banner:

"I've read &amp; consent to terms in IS user agreem't."

Protection of log data includes ensuring log data is not accidentally lost or deleted. Backing up audit records to a different system or onto separate media than the system being audited on an organizationally defined frequency helps ensure, in the event of a catastrophic system failure, the audit records will be retained. 

This helps to ensure a compromise of the information system being audited does not also result in a compromise of the audit records.

This requirement only applies to applications that have a native backup capability for audit records. Operating system backup requirements cover applications that do not provide native backup functions.

Intune audit logs can be sent to many locations, including Azure Monitor services or a third-party audit management server. If sending Intune audit logs to the Azure monitor, follow the setup instructions listed here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/review-logs-using-azure-monitor.

To manually offload audit logs to an audit log management server, follow these instructions:

1. Log in to the console.

2. Select "Tenant Administration".

3. Select "Audit Logs".

4. Select "Export".

If an attacker compromises an account, the entire MDM server infrastructure is at risk. Providing automated support functions for the management of accounts will ensure only active accounts will be granted access with the proper authorization levels. These objectives are best achieved by configuring the MDM server to leverage an enterprise authentication mechanism (e.g., Microsoft Active Directory Kerberos). 

To ensure individual accountability and prevent unauthorized access, application users must be individually identified and authenticated. Individual accountability mandates that each user is uniquely identified. A group authenticator is a shared account or some other form of authentication that allows multiple unique individuals to access the application using a single account. If an application allows or provides for group authenticators, it must first individually authenticate users prior to implementing group authenticator functionality. Some applications may not have the need to provide a group authenticator; this is considered a matter of application design. In those instances where the application design includes the use of a group authenticator, this requirement will apply.

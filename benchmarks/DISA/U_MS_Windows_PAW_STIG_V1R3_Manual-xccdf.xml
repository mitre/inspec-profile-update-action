- Privileged access management service
- Credential management service
- Security management service (anti-virus, network monitoring/scanning, IDS/IPS, etc.)
- Any sensitive business/mission service
- Any other IT resource designated as high value by the AO

Note: A high-value IT resource is defined as any IT resource whose purpose is considered critical to the organization or whose loss or compromise would cause a significant impact on the organization.

Note: Sensitive business/mission service is any business or mission service that needs additional protection from higher-risk IT services based on the nature of the function it provides; sensitivity of the data it consumes, processes, or stores; or criticality to the operation of the organization.

High-value IT resources are the most important and critical IT resources within an organization. They contain the most sensitive data in an organization, perform the most critical tasks of an organization, or have access to and can control all or nearly all IT resources within an organization. Administrator accounts for high-value IT resources must be protected against various threats and attacks because threats to sensitive privileged accounts are high and risk of compromise is increasing. Requiring a PAW used exclusively for remote administrative management of designated high-value IT resources, including servers, workstations, directory services, applications, databases, and network components, will provide a separate "channel" for the performance of administrative tasks on high-value IT resources and isolate these functions from the majority of threats and attack vectors found on higher-risk standard client systems.

Some IT resources, by the nature of the function they perform, should always be considered high value and should be remotely administered only via a PAW. The IT resources listed above are in this category.

Note: The term "manage" in the Requirement statement includes any remote connection to a high-value IT resource (for example, to view resource status and current configuration or to make changes to any resource configuration).&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Privileged Access Workstation (Windows)</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Privileged Access Workstation (Windows)</dc:subject><dc:identifier>3283</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-000366</ident><fixtext fixref="F-84865r1_fix">The Information System Security Manager (ISSM) or other site personnel will assist the Authorizing Official (AO) in designating and documenting which IT resources in the organization are high value.

A key security construct of a PAW is to separate administrative accounts into specific trust levels so that an administrator account used to manage an IT resource at one trust level cannot be used to manage IT resources at another trust level. This architecture protects IT resources in a tier from threats from higher-risk tiers. Isolating administrative accounts by forcing them to operate only within their assigned trust zone implements the concept of containment of security risks and adversaries within a specific zone. The Tier model prevents escalation of privilege by restricting what administrators can control and where they can log on.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Privileged Access Workstation (Windows)</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Privileged Access Workstation (Windows)</dc:subject><dc:identifier>3283</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-002227</ident><fixtext fixref="F-84867r2_fix">Set up an administrative tier model for the domain (for example, the Microsoft recommended Tier 0-2 AD administrative tier model).

Set up an Admin Organizational Unit (OU) Framework to host site PAWs. (Recommend the Microsoft PAW scripts be used to set up the PAW OU and group framework. They can be downloaded at http://aka.ms/PAWmedia.)

For example:

- Admin\Tier 0\Accounts
- Admin\Tier 1\Accounts
- Admin\Tier 2\Accounts

- Admin\Tier 1\Groups
- Admin\Tier 2\Groups

- Admin\Tier 1\Devices
- Admin\Tier 2\Devices

Note: If using the Microsoft scripts, after running the scripts, PAW Users Tier 0, PAW Users Tier 1, and PAW Users Tier 2 groups may need to be created under Admin/Tier 0/Groups, Admin/Tier 1/Groups, and Admin/Tier 2/Groups, respectively. 

Set up administrative accounts for each assigned administrator for high-value IT resources.

Based on the list of high-value IT resources with assigned administrative tier level, move Tier 0-2 administrative accounts to the appropriate Organizational Units and add the appropriate members to the relevant groups. Make sure each account and group has been assigned to one and only one tier.

A main security architectural construct of a PAW is that the workstation is isolated from most Internet threats, including phishing, impersonation, and credential theft attacks. This isolation is partially implemented by blocking all outbound connections to the Internet.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Privileged Access Workstation (Windows)</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Privileged Access Workstation (Windows)</dc:subject><dc:identifier>3283</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-002399</ident><fixtext fixref="F-84905r1_fix">Configure the PAW host-based firewall to block outbound connection requests to the Internet gateway or configure the PAW with an Internet proxy address with a loopback address.

If the PAW host-based firewall method is used, configure the firewall to block outbound connection requests to the Internet gateway. The exact configuration procedure will depend on which host-based firewall (for example, Host-Based Security System [HBSS]) is used on the PAW. DoD sites should refer to DoD policies and firewall STIGs to determine acceptable firewalls products.

If the Internet proxy address with a loopback address method is used, consider using the configuration instructions listed in of the Microsoft Privileged Access Workstation paper.

Ask site personnel how outbound connections from the PAW to the Internet have been blocked. Two common methods are to either configure the host-based firewall to block all outbound connection requests to the Internet gateway or to configure the PAW with an Internet proxy address with a loopback address. Based on the method used at the site, review either the configuration of the host-based firewall or the PAW configuration and verify the configuration blocks all outbound Internet connections except to communicate with IT resources being managed via the PAW, with domain controllers, or with a digital credential verification service (for example, OCSP).

If the site has configured the PAW with a loopback address, verify a proxy server group policy has been set up with a loopback address (127.0.0.1) and assigned to the PAW Users group.

If the PAW system has not been configured to block all outbound connections to the Internet from a PAW except to communicate with IT resources being managed via the PAW, with domain controllers, or with a digital credential verification service, this is a finding.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-78185"><title>SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-92891r1_rule" severity="medium" weight="10.0"><version>WPAW-00-002300</version><title>The local Administrators group on the Windows PAW must only include groups with accounts specifically designated to administer the PAW.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;A main security architectural construct of a PAW is to restrict access to the PAW from only specific privileged accounts designated for managing the high-value IT resources the PAW has been designated to manage.

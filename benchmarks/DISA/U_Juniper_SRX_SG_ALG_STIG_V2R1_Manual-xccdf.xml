The lack of authorization-based access control could result in the immediate compromise and unauthorized access to sensitive information. All DoD systems must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods that do not rely solely on authentication for authorized access.

Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset.

The Juniper Technical Library, Understanding User Role Firewalls, explains this Juniper SRX functionality in detail. This function integrates user-based firewall policies. Administrators can permit or restrict network access of employees, contractors, partners, and other users based on the roles they are assigned. User role firewalls enable greater threat mitigation, provide more informative forensic resources, improve record archiving for regulatory compliance, and enhance routine access provisioning. User role firewalls are more feasible with sites that do not have production workload and are used for employees to access network resources as opposed to large-scale datacenter environments.

User role firewalls trigger two actions, retrieval of user and/or role information associated with the traffic, and determine the action to take based on six match criteria within the context of the zone pair.

The source-identity field distinguishes a user role firewall from other types of firewalls. If the source identity is specified in any policy for a particular zone pair, it is a user role firewall. The user and role information must be retrieved before policy lookup occurs. If the source identity is not specified in any policy, user and role lookup is not required.

To retrieve user and role information, authentication tables are searched for an entry with an IP address corresponding to the traffic. If an entry is found, the user is classified as an authenticated user. If not found, the user is classified as an unauthenticated user.

The username and roles associated with an authenticated user are retrieved for policy matching. Both the authentication classification and the retrieved user and role information are used to match the source-identity field.

Characteristics of the traffic are matched to the policy specifications. Within the zone context, the first policy that matches the user or role and the five standard match criteria determines the action to be applied to the traffic."&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Juniper SRX Services Gateway ALG</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Juniper SRX Services Gateway ALG</dc:subject><dc:identifier>4004</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">V-66003</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">SV-80493</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-000213</ident><fixtext fixref="F-15722r297239_fix">Configure attribute-based security policies to enforce approved authorizations for logical access to information and system resources using the following commands.

To configure redirection from the SRX Series device to the Access Control Service, from configuration mode, configure the UAC profile for the captive portal &lt;acs-device&gt;.

[edit]
set services unified-access-control captive-portal &lt;acs-device-name&gt; redirect-traffic unauthenticated

Configure the redirection URL for the Access Control Service or a default URL for the captive portal.

[edit]
set services unified-access-control captive-portal acs-device redirect-url https://%ic-url%/?target=%dest-url%&amp;enforcer=%enforcer-id%

This policy specifies the default target and enforcer variables to be used by the Access Control Service to direct the user back after authentication. This ensures that changes to system specifications will not affect configuration results.

Configure a user role firewall policy that redirects HTTP traffic from zone trust to zone untrust if the source-identity is unauthenticated-user. The captive portal profile name is specified as the action to be taken for traffic matching this policy. The following is an example only since there the actual policy is dependent on the architecture of the organization's network.

The DoD requires centralized management of all network component audit record content. Network components requiring centralized audit log management must have the capability to support centralized management. The content captured in audit records must be managed from a central location (necessitating automation). Centralized management of audit records and logs provides for efficiency in maintenance and management of records, as well as the backup and archiving of those records. Ensure at least one Syslog server and local files are configured to support requirements. However, the Syslog itself must also be configured to filter event records so it is not overwhelmed. A best practice when configuring the external Syslog server is to add similar log-prefixes to the log file names to help and researching of central Syslog server. Another best practice is to add a match condition to limit the recorded events to those containing the regular expression (REGEX). This requirement does not apply to audit logs generated on behalf of the device itself (management).

While the Juniper SRX inherently has the capability to generate log records, by default only the high facility levels are captured and only to local files.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Juniper SRX Services Gateway ALG</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Juniper SRX Services Gateway ALG</dc:subject><dc:identifier>4004</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">V-66307</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">SV-80797</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-001844</ident><fixtext fixref="F-15725r297248_fix">Logging for security-related sources such as screens and security policies must be configured separately.

Audit processing failures include: software/hardware errors, failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded. Responses to audit failure depend upon the nature of the failure mode.

Since availability is an overriding concern given the role of the Juniper SRX in the enterprise, the system must not be configured to shut down in the event of a log processing failure. The system will be configured to log events to local files which will provide a log backup. If communication with the syslog server is lost or the server fails, the network device must continue to queue log records locally. Upon restoration of the connection to the centralized collection server, action should be taken to synchronize the local log data with the collection server.

By default, both traffic log and system log events are sent to a local log file named messages. You can create a separate log file that contains only traffic log messages so that you do not need to filter for traffic log messages. This makes it easier to track usage patterns or troubleshoot issues for a specific policy. 

A best practice is to add log-prefixes to the log file names to help in researching the events and filters to prevent log overload.

If the network does not provide safeguards against DoS attack, network resources will be unavailable to users. The Juniper SRX must include protection against DoS attacks that originate from inside the enclave, which can affect either internal or external systems. These attacks may use legitimate or rogue endpoints from inside the enclave. These attacks can be simple "floods" of traffic to saturate circuits or devices, malware that consumes CPU and memory on a device or causes it to crash, or a configuration issue that disables or impairs the proper function of a device. For example, an accidental or deliberate misconfiguration of a routing table can misdirect traffic for multiple networks.

The Juniper SRX Firewall uses Screens and Security Policies to detect known DoS attacks with known attack vectors. However, these Screens and policies must be applied to outbound traffic using zones and interface stanzas. 

Traffic exits the Juniper SRX by way of interfaces. Security zones are configured for one or more interfaces with the same security requirements for filtering data packets. A security zone implements a security policy for one or multiple network segments.

In accordance with CCI-001242, the ALG which provides content inspection services is a real-time intrusion detection system. These systems must generate an alert when detection events from real-time monitoring occur as required by CCI-2262 and CCI-2261.

The ALG must either send the alert to a management console that is actively monitored by authorized personnel or use a messaging capability to send the alert directly to designated personnel. Alerts must be sent immediately to designated individuals. Alerts may be sent via NMS, SIEM, Syslog configuration, SNMP trap or notice, or manned console message.

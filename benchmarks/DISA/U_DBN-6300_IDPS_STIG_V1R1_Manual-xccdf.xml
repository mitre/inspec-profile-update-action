Failure to detect attacks that use unauthorized data mining techniques to attack databases may result in the compromise of information.

SQL Injection attacks allow an attacker to inject code into a program or query or inject malware onto a computer to execute remote commands that can read or modify a database, or change data on a website. Web applications frequently access databases to store, retrieve, and update information. An attacker can construct inputs that the database will execute. This is most commonly referred to as a SQL injection attack. 

IDPS component(s) with the capability to detect code injections must be included in the IDPS implementation to detect unauthorized data mining. These components must include behavior-based anomaly detection algorithms to monitor for atypical database queries or accesses.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target DB Networks DBN-6300 IDPS</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>DB Networks DBN-6300 IDPS</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2949</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-002346</ident><fixtext fixref="F-70917r2_fix">Configure a database for SQL injection protection.

Enable the SQL injection detection capabilities on the applicable interface for the database to be protected.

Navigate to Admin &gt;&gt; Capture &gt;&gt; Capture Sources.

Select the interface connected the network that contains the database traffic.

Click on the "Enable" button and ensure the "Link up" indicator turns green.

Map the database.

Navigate to Database &gt;&gt; Database Mapping and find the database to be protected.

Click on the check box on the left.

Click on the first button at the top of the table which, when hovering over the button, is labeled “Map selected service to new db using their default names". The Mapping Status of the database will change to "Pending Mapping".

On the left side of the screen above the label that says "showing", click the button with the arrow. The Mapping Status for the database will change to "Mapped". 

Note: The learning process requires enough database traffic to properly characterize normal application behavior.

Navigate to Learning &gt;&gt; Time Regions and click on the left arrow to expand the window.

Click on the plus sign to view the captured traffic.

Organizations must capture a significant amount of traffic to enable the device to learn the traffic patterns. The vendor recommends at least three or more days of database traffic learning depending on the organization's traffic volume.

Off-loading is a common process in information systems with limited audit storage capacity. The audit storage on the IDPS is used only in a transitory fashion until the system can communicate with the centralized log server designated for storing the audit records, at which point the information is transferred. However, DoD requires that the log be transferred in real time, which indicates that the time from event detection to off-loading is seconds or less.

Configuration settings are the set of parameters that can be changed that affect the security posture and/or functionality of the network element. Security-related parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of the network element, including the parameters required to satisfy other security control requirements. For the network element, security-related parameters include settings for communications traffic management configurations. If the DBN-6300 is installed incorrectly in the site's network architecture, vulnerable databases may not be detected and consequently may remain unprotected. 
 
To ensure optimum protection, the DBN-6300 must be logically installed between the application and database tiers of the network. The device has multiple interfaces that allow several connections to accommodate various network architectures. The device is installed as a passive listening device on all applicable subnetworks using the available ports. When placed correctly, the device monitors the "last mile" prior to database access, which is where SQL is optimally monitored.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target DB Networks DBN-6300 IDPS</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>DB Networks DBN-6300 IDPS</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2949</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-000366</ident><fixtext fixref="F-70965r5_fix">Evaluate the site architecture to determine where the optimum logical connections would provide maximum database visibility.

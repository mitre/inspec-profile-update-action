SQL Injection attacks allow an attacker to inject code into a program or query or inject malware onto a computer to execute remote commands that can read or modify a database, or change data on a website. Web applications frequently access databases to store, retrieve, and update information. An attacker can construct inputs that the database will execute. This is most commonly referred to as a SQL injection attack.

Integration is more than centralized logging and a centralized management console. The enclave's monitoring capability may include multiple sensors, IPS, sensor event databases, behavior-based monitoring devices, application-level content inspection systems, malicious code protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, and network monitoring software. Some tools may monitor external traffic while others monitor internal traffic at key boundaries.  
 
These capabilities may be implemented using different devices and therefore can have different security policies and severity-level schema.

Configuration settings are the set of parameters that can be changed that affect the security posture and/or functionality of the network element. Security-related parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of the network element, including the parameters required to satisfy other security control requirements. For the network element, security-related parameters include settings for communications traffic management configurations. If the DBN-6300 is installed incorrectly in the site's network architecture, vulnerable databases may not be detected and consequently may remain unprotected. 
 
To ensure optimum protection, the DBN-6300 must be logically installed between the application and database tiers of the network. The device has multiple interfaces that allow several connections to accommodate various network architectures.

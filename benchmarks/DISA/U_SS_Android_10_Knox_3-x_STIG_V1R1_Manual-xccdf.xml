The ability to crack a password is a function of how many attempts an adversary is permitted, how quickly an adversary can do each attempt, and the size of the password space. The longer the minimum length of the password is, the larger the password space. Having a too-short minimum password length significantly reduces password strength, increasing the chance of password compromise and resulting device and data compromise.

If a user is allowed to make exceptions to the data sharing restriction policy, the user could enable unauthorized sharing of data, leaving it vulnerable to breach. Limiting the granting of exceptions to either the Administrator or common application developer mitigates this risk.

Copy/paste of data between applications in different application processes or groups of application processes is considered an exception to the access control policy and therefore, the Administrator must be able to enable/disable the feature. Other exceptions include allowing any data or application sharing between process groups.

Multi-user mode allows multiple users to share a mobile device by providing a degree of separation between user data. To date, no mobile device with multi-user mode features meets DoD requirements for access control, data separation, and non-repudiation for user accounts. In addition, the MDFPP does not include design requirements for multi-user account services. Disabling multi-user mode mitigates the risk of not meeting DoD multi-user account security policies.

If the MOS were to accept an invalid certificate, it could take unauthorized actions, resulting in unanticipated outcomes. At the same time, if the MOS were to disable functionality when it could not determine the validity of the certificate, this could result in a denial of service. Therefore, the ability to provide exceptions is appropriate to balance the tradeoff between security and functionality. Always accepting certificates when they cannot be determined to be valid is the most extreme exception policy and is not appropriate in the DoD context.

- If the Purebred key management app is used, users are responsible for maintaining positive control of their credentialed device at all times. The DoD PKI certificate policy requires subscribers to maintain positive control of the devices that contain private keys and to report any loss of control so the credentials can be revoked. Upon device retirement, turn-in, or reassignment, ensure a factory data reset is performed prior to device hand-off. Follow Mobility service provider decommissioning procedures as applicable. 

- How to configure the following UBE controls (users must configure the control) on the Samsung device:
1. Secure use of Calendar Alarm.
2. Local screen mirroring and MirrorLink procedures (authorized/not authorized for use).
3. Do not connect Samsung devices (either via DeX Station or dongle) to any DoD network via Ethernet connection.

Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is a protocol for obtaining the revocation status of a certificate. It addresses problems associated with using CRLs.

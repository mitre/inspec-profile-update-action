Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their application session prior to vacating the vicinity, applications need to be able to identify when a user's application session has idled and take action to initiate the session lock.

The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be determined and/or controlled. This is typically at the operating system level and results in a system lock but may be at the application level where the application interface window is secured instead.

Before granting access to the system, the MobileIron Core v10 server/server platform is required to display the DoD-approved system use notification message or banner that provides privacy and security notices consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. This ensures the legal requirements for auditing and monitoring are met.

The non-bracketed text below must be used without any changes as the warning banner. 

[A. Use this banner for desktops, laptops, and other devices accommodating banners of 1300 characters. The banner must be implemented as a click-through banner at logon (to the extent permitted by the operating system), meaning it prevents further activity on the information system unless and until the user executes a positive action to manifest agreement by clicking on a box indicating “OK.”]

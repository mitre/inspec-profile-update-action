This can happen if information in the form of charts, pictures, or maps are displayed on a wall within the viewing or capture range of a camera. Any pan, tilt, and zoom (PTZ) capabilities of the camera must be considered. One may consider visual information out of range, but it may be in range considering camera capabilities such as high definition, PTZ, and video enhancement possibilities for captured frames. Inadvertent display of classified information could also happen if the information is lying on a desk or table unprotected.

NOTES: 
- Vulnerability awareness and operational training will be provided to users of VTC and video/collaboration communications-related cameras regarding these requirements.
- This requirement is relevant no matter what the classification level of the session. In an IP environment, the classification of VTC or PC communications depends on the classification of the network to which the VTU or PC is attached and the classification of the facility in which it is located. While classified communications can occur at the same level of classification as the network and facility, communications having a lower or no classification (e.g., unclassified or CUI) may also occur in the same environment.

This same sensitivity is included in VTUs that are used in office spaces. This has one disadvantage. The microphones can pick up sidebar conversations that have no relationship to the conference or call in progress. 

Likewise, in an open area, received conference audio can be broadcast to others in the area that are not part of the conference and possibly should not be exposed to the conference information for need-to-know reasons. Speakerphones exhibit a similar vulnerability. This is the same confidentiality vulnerability posed to audible sound information in the environment as discussed above, with the added twist that the conference audio is vulnerable to others in the environment. While this is more of an issue in environments where classified conversations normally occur, it is also an issue in any environment. This is of particularly concern in open work areas or open offices where multiple people work in near proximity. 

Users or operators of VTC systems of any type must take care regarding who can hear what is being said during a conference call and what unrelated conversations can be picked up by the sensitive microphone. Where a VTU is used by a single person in an open area, a partial mitigation for this could be the use of a headset with earphones and a microphone. While this would limit the ability of others to hear audio from the conference and could also limit the audio pickup of unrelated conversations, it may not be fully effective. 

In some instances, such as when a VTU is located in a SCIF, a Push-to-Talk (PTT) handset/headset may be required Microphones embedded in or connected to a communications endpoint, PC, or PC monitor can be sensitive enough to pick up sound that is not related to a given communications session. They could pick up nearby conversations and other sounds. This capability could compromise sensitive or classified information that is not related to the communications in progress. Speakers embedded in or connected to a communications endpoint or PC can be made loud enough to be heard across a room or in the next workspace. This capability could compromise sensitive or classified information that is being communicated during a session. 

Users must be aware of other conversations in the area and their sensitivity when using any communications endpoint (not only a PC-based voice, video, or collaboration communications application). This awareness must then translate into protecting or eliminating these other conversations. A short-range, reduced-gain, or noise-cancelling microphone may be required. A PTT microphone may also be required for classified areas. The microphone should be muted when the user is not speaking as both mitigation for this issue and proper etiquette when participating in a conference. The muting function should be performed using a positively controlled disconnect, shorting switch, or mechanism instead of a software-controlled mute function on the PC. 

Users must be aware of other people in the area that could hear what is being communicated. This is particularly an issue if the communicated information is sensitive or classified because the parties overhearing the information may not have proper clearance or a need-to-know. To mitigate this issue, a headset or speakers should be used and at a volume that only the user can hear.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Enterprise Voice, Video, and Messaging Policy</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Enterprise Voice, Video, and Messaging Policy</dc:subject><dc:identifier>5585</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-002213</ident><fixtext fixref="F-63529r946593_fix">Ensure a policy and procedure is in place and enforced that addresses the placement and operation of hardware-based voice and video communications devices and PC-based voice, video, UC, and collaboration communications applications with regard to their audio pickup and broadcast capabilities in relation to the sensitivity of the information communicated.

This makes it difficult for someone to add unauthorized digital instruments to the system. However, this could be done more easily with older analog systems by tapping an existing analog line. 

With Enterprise Voice, Video, and Messaging, this is no longer the case. Most IPT/VoIP systems employ an automatic means of detecting and registering a new instrument on the network with the call management server and then downloading its configuration to the instrument. This presents a vulnerability whereby unauthorized instruments could be added to the system or instruments could be moved without authorization. Such activity can happen anywhere there is an active network port or outlet. 

This is not only a configuration management problem. It could also allow theft of services or some other malicious attack. It is recognized however, that auto-registration is necessary during large deployments of VoIP terminals, and for a short time thereafter, to facilitate additions and troubleshooting. This applies to initial system setup and any subsequent large redeployments or additions. Normal, day-to-day moves, adds, and changes will require manual registration. Because it may be possible for an unauthorized VoIP terminal to be added to the system easily during auto-registration, the registration logs must be compared to the authorized terminal inventory. 

Alternately, the system could have a method of automatically registering only preauthorized terminals. This feature would support VoIP terminals that are AO approved for connection from multiple local or remote locations. It is critical to the security of the system that all IPT/VoIP end instruments be authorized to connect to and use the system. Only authorized instruments should be configured in the system controller and therefore allowed to operate. Unauthorized instruments could lead to system compromise or abuse. A manual inventory of authorized end instruments will aid in the detection of unauthorized instruments registered to the system, particularly during the period when autodetection/registration is permitted. This will also aid in certification and accreditation efforts.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Enterprise Voice, Video, and Messaging Policy</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Enterprise Voice, Video, and Messaging Policy</dc:subject><dc:identifier>5585</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-000073</ident><fixtext fixref="F-63541r946629_fix">Ensure that an inventory of authorized instruments is documented and maintained.

NOTE: This is applicable to a classified LAN connected to a classified WAN (such as the SIPRNet). 

In the case of a classified WAN where networkwide address-based accountability or traceability is required by the network PMO, the PMO must provide segregated, networkwide address block(s) so the attached classified LANs can meet this requirement. DISA provides a worldwide VoIP-based voice communications service called the DISN Voice over Secret IP (VoSIP). This service is managed by the DRSN PMO. This service also provides gateways into the DRSN. 

In support of the above requirement, the SIPRNet PMO has designated specific dedicated address ranges for use by the DISN VoSIP service and assigned these address blocks to the DRSN/VoSIP PMO for VoSIP address management and assignment. The VoSIP service provides VoIP-based communications between VoIP systems within the customer's classified LANs (C-LANs) operating at the secret level while using the SIPRNet WAN for the inter-enclave (inter-LAN) transport. 

Additionally, the SIPRNet PMO requires networkwide address-based accountability or traceability based on assigned IP address. The customer's SIPRNet-connected secret C-LANs use addresses assigned by the SIPRNet PMO. Therefore, customers of the DISN VoSIP service must use IP addresses assigned to them by the DRSN/VoSIP PMO when addressing the VoIP controllers and endpoints within their C-LANs. This is to maintain the segregation of the voice and data environments on the customer's secret C-LANs as required by this SRG. This also facilitates proper routing and flow control over the traffic between VoSIP addresses. 

The DISN service is designated DISN Voice over Secret IP but uses an acronym (VoSIP), which also means Voice over Secure IP. Voice over Secure IP relates to any VoIP-based service on a secure or classified IP network. 

While the DISN VoSIP service is the preferred means to interconnect SIPRNet-connected secret C-LANs for VoIP service, there may be a need for an organization to implement a VoIP-based voice or video communications system within their organization or with close partners. If such a system has no need or potential need to communicate with other enclaves that use the DISN VoSIP service, they must use their own dedicated IP address space carved out of the address space assigned to their C-LANs by the SIPRNet PMO.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Enterprise Voice, Video, and Messaging Policy</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Enterprise Voice, Video, and Messaging Policy</dc:subject><dc:identifier>5585</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-000073</ident><fixtext fixref="F-63542r946632_fix">Ensure customers of the DISN VoSIP service use IP addresses assigned to them by the DRSN/VoSIP PMO when defining the required dedicated address space for the VoIP controllers and endpoints within their secret C-LANs.

- Does the organization's secret C-LAN support VVoIP communications (not dedicated IP-based VTC)?
- Does organization's secret C-LAN VVoIP system interconnect with other enclaves using the DISN VoSIP service?
- What address blocks are dedicated to the VVoIP system on the C-LAN?
- Is there documented evidence that the DRSN/VoSIP PMO assigned these addresses to the organization, or can such assignment be validated by other means?

This discussion relates to UC soft client-specific accessories, which consist of USB phones, USB ATAs, and PPGs. A USB phone is a physical USB-connected telephone instrument that associates itself with the UC soft client application running on the PC. It minimally provides a handset that includes both the mouthpiece and receiver and may provide a dial pad, a speakerphone function, or other functions. They should be operated accordingly. 

A USB ATA is a USB-connected device that associates itself with the UC soft client application and provides the ability to use a standard analog telephone or speakerphone. Some USB ATAs also provide a port to which an analog phone line can be connected. This allows a single analog phone to be used with the UC soft client while also answering and placing calls via the analog phone line. This line could be connected to a local PBX or to the PSTN. Some USB phones contain a port to which an analog phone line can be connected so the USB phone can be used with it to place and receive calls. There is little risk in the operation of this kind of USB ATA or USB phone, providing it operates only as described and there is no direct bridging of networks as described next. 

A PPG (USB connected or internal card) is a type of ATA that is a gateway intended to bridge the UC soft client application and supporting VVoIP network to an analog phone line from a local PBX or the PSTN. PPGs pose legal and fraud threats to a DOD network due to this bridging of networks. They can be used for toll fraud, toll avoidance, or placing or receiving unauthorized calls. Some USB phones can contain a PPG. While these devices might be used to meet a specific mission requirement, their use may be illegal in certain countries and instances when connected between a DOD IP voice and data network and a public dial-up voice network. The use of any UC soft client accessory that provides a network bridging function poses both a legal and an IA threat to the DOD voice communications network. PPGs must not be used except to fulfill a validated and approved mission requirement.

While this degrades the protections afforded a hardware-based system, the trend is to use more and more PC-based communications applications due to their advanced features, collaborative benefits, and perceived reduced cost. This soft-phone use case results in the elimination of hardware-based telephones on users' desks in the workplace. This can be seen as, or result in, trading down (from a hardware-based system) with regard to availability, reliability, and quality of service because the data network is generally more susceptible to compromise from many sources inside and outside the local LAN, making the soft-phones more exposed to attack. 

This also means no telephone will be available in the workspace if the PC is not powered on, the application is not loaded, or the PC is not fully functional. While this is undesirable from an IA standpoint, a business case can be developed to support it. 

NOTE: The recommended relationship between PC soft-phone/UC applications and hardware-based endpoints in the normal work area is that the PC application should augment the functionality of, or be a backup to, the hardware-based instrument in the user's workspace. The implementation of PC soft-phones or UC applications in the user workspace as their only endpoint has several ramifications that must be considered. These include: 

- The PC becomes a single point of failure for communications services provided to a user in their workspace. A widespread problem, which affects many PCs or the network infrastructure, may disable all communications for many users at one time. Users may not have a means to report the failure without using an alternate communications system. A fast-spreading worm or power outage could create such a situation. While some may argue that "users can call on their cell phones", service may not be available, or their use may not be permitted in the facility. This translates into the loss of functionality and efficiency, as in lost time, due to the inability to communicate when the PC or soft-phone application is not running or functioning properly.

- The protections afforded hardware-based endpoints by the use of the voice protection zone, such as VoIP VLAN(s) and others, are missing for soft-phones in a widespread use/implementation scenario and, depending on the implementation on the PC, may degrade the protections afforded hardware-based endpoints. Such is the case for all software-based communications endpoints because they are typically implemented on all PCs and therefore will be connected to the data VLANs. Assured service for voice traffic will be degraded from that obtained with hardware-based instruments connected in the voice protection zone. This translates into the following additional IA measures required to protect the VoIP infrastructure (e.g., a firewall between the VoIP and data VLANs):
 
- The hardware-based endpoint is not available for use in parallel with, or in place of, the PC. This can be a problem if the PC is having performance or operational issues, is turned off, or is unavailable. Accessing help desk services requiring logging on to the PC to use the voice services and work on a problem could be a real challenge. Rebooting the PC to clear a problem would disconnect the call to the helpdesk. Accessing voice mail or answering the phone while the PC is booting is made impossible, reducing efficiency, particularly when the user starts their day. If the user has command and control (C2) responsibilities, the IP equivalent of MLPP cannot function properly if an application or PC is unavailable. Precedence calls will not be received by the user but will be transferred to their designated alternate answering point. 

- Emergency communications could be unavailable if the PC is not booted, the communications application is not running, or either is otherwise compromised. Voice communications must be readily available for life safety and medical reasons, as well as other facility security emergencies. A partial mitigation for this in a "soft-phone world" is to place common use hardware telephones within a short distance (e.g., 30 to 50 feet) of every workspace, which is an additional cost. This additional distance, however, could be an issue in a medical emergency where a worker might be alone in their workspace and their PC or voice communications application is not functioning properly. They may not be able to reach the common use instrument depending on the nature of the medical emergency. If the worker was suffering a heart attack or diabetic emergency, they could die. Business cases therefore need to include the cost of insurance and/or lawsuits for this eventuality. 

The previous two items translate into the following the addition of common-use hardware-based instruments placed around the facility (for backup and emergency use) along with the additionally required LAN cabling and access switch ports. While some may believe this is not an IA issue, it is because the discussion is about availability, which is one of the prime tenets of IA. 

Additionally, the VoIP controllers (i.e., the equipment that controls the telephone system) must be able to be accessed by the PC soft-phones while being protected as they would be in a normal VoIP system using hardware-based instruments.

This means there is a validated mission need and the number of UC soft clients permitted to operate inside the LAN will be less than the number of hardware-based phones in the LAN. This number should be limited to UC soft clients required to meet specific mission requirements. 

There are scenarios for the use of limited numbers of UC soft clients in the strategic LAN. The first of these scenarios is providing support for UC soft clients associated with a VoIP system in another enclave. This is a remote access scenario and must operate as they would in a normal remote access use case. If this scenario is approved, special accommodations must be made in the local LAN to support users from a remote LAN and permit them to connect to their home enclave. This could include segregating them on a separate dedicated LAN with its own boundary protection or by implementing a dedicated VLAN protection zone while opening the enclave boundary to permit the remote connection. 

Voice/video and data must reside on separate VLANs for the protection of the voice infrastructure. However, recognizing that requiring a NIC to be configured to support voice/video and data VLANs is not a viable solution, voice and data traffic can coexist in the data VLAN when leaving the workstation.

When limited numbers of UC soft clients associated with the local VoIP system are implemented in the strategic LAN, a separate VLAN structure must be implemented for them. Implementation of a VLAN must not provide a bridge between the VoIP and data VLANs. Traffic must be filtered such that the UC soft client's VoIP traffic is routed to the VoIP VLAN while all other traffic is routed to the data VLAN. A separate NIC is not required to support VLANs for voice and video segmentation under UC.

NOTE: Limited numbers in this scenario means as few as possible but may mean 25 or 30 percent of the overall PCs on the LAN. Beyond this percentage, the protections afforded by this implementation become limited or negated because of the large number of PCs in the UC soft client VLAN.

Determine if limited numbers of UC soft clients are permitted to operate or are implemented in the strategic LAN. If so, review the written AO approval for the implementation.

Traditional computer telephony integration CTI encompasses the control of a telephone or telecommunications switch by a computer application. Interfaces have been developed to provide connection between the computer, typically a workstation, and the telephone or other terminal attached to the telephone switch, and possibly a special analog or TDM line going directly to the telephone switch. 

Applications are also developed to use these interfaces to integrate a data application with the telephone system. Sometimes the integration is as simple as being able to dial a number from the computer application, or it could provide full control of the switch as in the case of an operator's console. 

In these traditional scenarios, the voice stayed in a traditional telephone set and the data stayed on the computer with the exception of the control information. If the voice does enter the computer, it is sent directly to the sound card or converted to a sound file for storage and possible file transfer. The voice communication is not transmitted in real time via IP protocols. In contrast, modern-day CTI is changing in that today the voice communications and control is being transmitted using IP protocols, and the hardware interfaces and telephones are being replaced by computer applications. 

NOTE: The CTI systems discussed here are not Enterprise Voice, Video, and Messaging applications, although some of the features are similar. CTI systems generally have a special function and are not a general user application. These are typically Call Center or Help Desk applications. This type of CTI typically involves integration with a database application. In this scenario, where soft-phones are an integral part of the CTI system/application, implementation of separate voice and data zones could be detrimental to the proper functioning of the application. While separation requirements should be enforced if possible, they could be relaxed providing the general CTI requirement of treating the CTI system as an enclave is followed. A system such as this should have its own VoIP controller. If the system needs to communicate with systems outside the CTI system enclave, proper boundary protection must be provided. For example, because IP soft-phones are prevalent in today's call center/helpdesk systems, such a system would require the ability to place and receive phone calls from outside the CTI enclave. Calls might leave and enter the enclave via VoIP or a TDM media gateway. The workstations and call center agents may also need to email and access the web. 

NOTE: A network supporting a CTI application must be segregated from the enclave. This can be accomplished by maintaining a closed network or a segregated and access-controlled subenclave having appropriate boundary protection.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Enterprise Voice, Video, and Messaging Policy</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Enterprise Voice, Video, and Messaging Policy</dc:subject><dc:identifier>5585</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-001548</ident><fixtext fixref="F-63547r946647_fix">Implement a Call Center or CTI system using soft clients to be segregated into a protected enclave and limit traffic traversing the boundary.</fixtext><fix id="F-63547r946647_fix" /><check system="C-63640r946646_chk"><check-content-ref href="Enterprise_Voice,_Video,_and_Messaging_Policy_SRG.xml" name="M" /><check-content>Review the site documentation to confirm a Call Center or CTI system using soft clients must be segregated into a protected enclave and limit traffic traversing the boundary.

- The supporting network is configured as a closed enclave or a segregated and access-controlled subenclave having appropriate boundary protection between it and the local general business LAN or external WAN.
- If the CTI application accesses resources outside this enclave and the application could be compromised from external sources, the supporting network is configured to provide separate voice and data zones and maintains separation of voice and data traffic per the VoIP STIG if technically feasible (i.e., such separation does not break the CTI application or there is another compelling reason).
- The supporting network enclave and boundary protection is configured in substantial compliance with the Enclave, Network Infrastructure, and VoIP STIGs.
- The CTI application/enclave (e.g., a call center application) is supported by a dedicated VoIP controller.

It is critical that phone service is available in the event of an emergency situation, such as a security breach or life safety event. The ability to place calls to emergency services must be maintained. DOD voice networks are designed to be extremely reliable and provide continuity of operations (COOP) support. 

However, the potential exists that a site may become severed from the DOD network. Some site's DOD VoIP phone systems are implemented without a local session controller. The session controller may be located remotely and serve several sites by providing long local service. This implementation scenario provides for central management of the overall phone system, saves in initial implementation cost, and saves in operating costs. Therefore, this scenario has many benefits. 

Unfortunately, to place a call between two endpoints within the local site or to place a call via the local commercial service connection, the initiating end instrument has to send its signal messages to the remote session controller over the DISN WAN connection, and then the session controller has to signal the called instrument or media gateway over the same WAN connection. Several messages are sent (back and forth) over the WAN connection before the two local endpoints can send their media streams directly between themselves. 

While the need to signal over the WAN connection can cause longer call setup time, which can be extended if there is congestion in the network, no call can be placed anywhere from the local site if it is cut off from its session controller. Based on this fact, and in support of maintaining viable local voice services in the event the site is cut off from its remote session controller, each physical site must maintain minimal local call control as a backup so that local intrasite and local commercial network calls can be placed. While this works to maintain local emergency service availability for security and life safety emergencies, it also provides the capability to make calls between DOD sites using the commercial network.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Enterprise Voice, Video, and Messaging Policy</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Enterprise Voice, Video, and Messaging Policy</dc:subject><dc:identifier>5585</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-001548</ident><fixtext fixref="F-63548r948755_fix">Implement and document the local Enterprise Voice, Video, and Messaging system with the capability to place intrasite and local phone calls when network connectivity is severed.

If the local commercial service is VoIP or VVoIP, this is a finding.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-259915"><title>SRG-VOIP-000350</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-259915r948761_rule" weight="10.0" severity="medium"><version>SRG-VOIP-000350</version><title>The enclave must be dual homed to two geographically diverse DISN SDNs and DISN WAN Service (NIPRNet or SIPRNet) Aggregation Routers (AR) or DISN Provider Edge (PE) routers.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Redundancy and dual homing is used within the DISN core to provide for continuity of operations (COOP) if a piece of equipment, circuit path, or an entire service delivery node is lost.

NOTES:
- This means there are two DISN (or commercial) access circuits (many circuits will have a commercial component, typically the "last mile") from the site/enclave to the DISN SDNs.
- This assumes the site/enclave is NOT collocated with a DISN SDN such that a direct Ethernet or optical connection can be made.
- If a site is located at a DISN SDN and is able to directly connect to the SDN using Ethernet or optical connections, the site may be able to rely on the dual homing of the SDN into the core. However, the site must still be homed to two geographically diverse ARs. This depends on the size or type of the SDN. A large site directly connected to a smaller SDN will implement an access circuit to a geographically diverse SDN (i.e., another SDN in another location remote from the local SDN). This should not be one of the SDNs to which the local SDN is homed.</fixtext><fix id="F-63553r946665_fix" /><check system="C-63646r946664_chk"><check-content-ref href="Enterprise_Voice,_Video,_and_Messaging_Policy_SRG.xml" name="M" /><check-content>Inspect the documentation showing how the enclave is connected to the DISN to determine compliance with the requirement.

The DISN core network is designed to be highly reliable and available in support of the DOD mission. The most vulnerable part of the network is the access circuit from the enclave to the core and the path it takes from the SDN to the customer's site.

The reliability, redundancy, and robustness of the CER, SBC, and power source are subverted when the facility represents a single point of failure. For a small number of C2 users this may be less concerning, but with more C2 users supported by the system, the greater the issue. Even less severe eventualities may limit the capability of the system to support reliable communications. 

The mitigation for this systemwide vulnerability is to implement redundant facilities to which the geographically diverse pathways containing the dual-homed access circuits can run and terminate on redundant, geographically separated sets of CERs, SBCs, and core LAN equipment. Session controllers can also be separated in this manner. 

This mitigation is costly, and facilities housing critical communications infrastructure are not lost very often. However, the cost of mitigating this vulnerability must be weighed against the loss of critical communications, particularly in time of crisis. If the site supports large numbers of high-level C2 users or Special-C2 users, the cost of losing communications may outweigh the cost of providing redundant facilities. Another consideration should be that access to emergency services via the communications system would also be lost. 

The threat to strategic facilities is greater from natural causes than from damage due to acts of war or terrorism. However, all threats must be considered. Tactical facilities have a higher vulnerability to acts of war, on a par with or exceeding the vulnerability posed by natural events.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Enterprise Voice, Video, and Messaging Policy</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Enterprise Voice, Video, and Messaging Policy</dc:subject><dc:identifier>5585</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-001606</ident><fixtext fixref="F-63556r946674_fix">Implement and document critical network equipment as redundant and in geographically diverse locations for a site supporting C2 users.

When additional services for SIP trunks are necessary, an ITSP may provide an "alternate connection", but this requires approval by the DODIN Waiver Panel and signature by the DOD CIO. 

Local ISP connections provide an internet pathway into the DISN, placing the DODIN directly at risk for exploitation. A local ISP connection can circumnavigate DOD protections of the DISN at its boundaries with the internet. Using commercial VoIP service from an ITSP requires the implementation of an internet service provider (ISP) connection, potentially providing a path to the internet. These types of connections must be approved and must meet the requirements in the Network Infrastructure STIG (NET0160) for an Internet Access Point (IAP).

ITSP connections may provide SIP trunks terminating on a media gateway, which then provides TDM trunks or POTS lines to traditional non-VoIP PBX, key system, or individual end instrument. ITSP connections terminating in a separate LAN from the enclave's DOD LAN may support a separate VoIP system. This connection type might be used for a small site having a small VoIP system or a few discrete phones dedicated to commercial network calling. 

Additional guidance for the selection and procurement of telecommunications services is discussed in the DODI 8100.4 "DOD Unified Capabilities (UC)" dated 9 Dec 2010 and the DOD Unified Capabilities Requirements 2013 (UCR 2013) documents.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Enterprise Voice, Video, and Messaging Policy</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Enterprise Voice, Video, and Messaging Policy</dc:subject><dc:identifier>5585</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-001606</ident><fixtext fixref="F-63557r946677_fix">Obtain approval by the DODIN Waiver Panel and signature by the DOD CIO for a permanent "alternate connection" to the ITSP for any connection with a commercial VoIP provider (ITSP).</fixtext><fix id="F-63557r946677_fix" /><check system="C-63650r946676_chk"><check-content-ref href="Enterprise_Voice,_Video,_and_Messaging_Policy_SRG.xml" name="M" /><check-content>Inspect the VVoIP implementation system design for connections to commercial VoIP ITSP.

In DOD, these communications can also include requests for Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF), explosive ordnance disposal, and similar emergency situations specific to the military. 

The inability of first responders to automatically locate the caller threatens life safety and facility protection or security. Contacting emergency services via the public telephone system has been mandated for many years in the United States and other countries around the world. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has mandated various aspects of providing enhanced FES communications and also relies on state legislation to extend these rules. The FCC rules primarily address public communications service providers, including traditional LEC and CLECs, mobile communications providers, and VoIP communications providers. 

DOD Instruction 6055.06, DOD Fire and Emergency Services (F&amp;ES) Program, provides DOD policy regarding emergency services and emergency services communications. The document primarily discusses fire protection, with specific provisions for telecommunications support for fire, medical, and security emergencies. Private telephone systems, in general, provide a large portion of the required telecommunication capability. All DOD private telephone systems, VoIP or traditional, must support enhanced emergency services communications for the completion of emergency calls. Per DOD Instruction 6055.06, all sites must support, provide for, and implement F&amp;ES telecommunications services. When implementing basic F&amp;ES telecommunications services, each country or region designates a specific standard telephone number or prefix code to be dialed that can be easily remembered by the public. In some instances, while not best practice, organizations might designate an internal emergency number for use within their telephone system. Examples of such numbers are as follows: 
- 911 in North America. 
- 112 in the EU and UK. 
- 000 in Australia. 

Issues may arise when an emergency call is originated through a private telephone system, such as a traditional PBX or a VVoIP system. While the LEC or CLEC may properly route the call in a priority manner, the same may not be true for the private system unless specifically addressed in the systems call routing tables and potentially other system features. Therefore, the private system must be configured to properly handle emergency communications. Enhanced F&amp;ES communications permits the answering station to automatically locate the caller. This is particularly helpful when the caller cannot provide their location. 

Enhanced F&amp;ES communications are mandated by the FCC and state legislation. Current implementation is a best practice. The enhanced F&amp;ES communications capability is enabled using Automatic Number Identification (ANI) and Phone Switch Automatic Location Identification (PS-ALI) information. ANI provides the telephone number of the calling party and is generated by the telephone system. PS-ALI associates the calling party's number (ANI information) with their location or registered address of the phone being used. PS-ALI is provided by a database maintained within the telephone system or externally. In many cases, the F&amp;ES answering service system will use the PS-ALI information to map the location of the calling phone. VoIP phones, on the other hand, can be connected anywhere in the world and function. This is an issue for commercial VoIP services that is being addressed by the FCC. ALI information in the private sector must be handled by the owners/operators of private telephone system. When a private telephone system supports enhanced F&amp;ES telecommunications, a PS-ALI database must be instituted, maintained, and kept current as endpoints and numbers move at a site. 

NOTE: For fire and emergency services, the requirements are for the site. The requirement must be met through the unclassified system. Classified systems at the site, because they only operate in secure areas without connection to public services, do not need to implement this requirement.

This is a two-part process that is exacerbated if the call originates from a DOD telephone system. 

Some of the FCC rules and state laws address the telephone system issue. For enterprise systems, the support for E911 by the enterprise Local Session Controller (LSC) (or any remote LSC construct) is governed by FCC rules, as well as other federal, state, and local law. The design and implementation of all telephone system systems must include reasonable efforts to provide E911, even when the access connection to the Enterprise LSC is severed.

Public enhanced F&amp;ES systems are implemented in conjunction with the local exchange carrier (LEC) using their central office switch (CO). When the designated F&amp;ES number is dialed, the CO routes the call to the public F&amp;ES answering point (PSAP) over special trunks that can provide the PSAP with the telephone number from which the emergency call originated and the geographic location of the originating telephone. The originating telephone number is provided as ANI information. The geographic location of the originating telephone is provided as ALI information. The ALI is generated from the ANI by looking up the ANI in a database. Typically, this function is performed by the LEC, and the ALI provided is the service delivery address for the telephone number. In some cases, the ALI information is housed in a database at the PSAP or a at a third-party provider such that the PSAP must make the "database dip" to identify the location of the caller. The information is regularly updated by the LEC based on new service deliveries and disconnections.

This process does not go far enough if the originating telephone is behind (part of) a DOD telephone system. A DOD telephone system may serve a large building or multiple buildings in a campus setting. It may also serve small or large remote sites that are geographically distant from the main telephone system switch. As discussed above, the normal process provides the address where the LEC delivers its phone service for the calling number. While this address will serve to get emergency services personnel to the lobby of a building or the front gate of a campus, it will not provide the exact location of the caller. This is where the federal and state telephone system related requirements come in. Under these rules, a telephone system operator and the system itself must provide complete ANI and ALI information to the answering point such that emergency services personnel can easily locate the caller. The telephone system must provide the exact location of the originating telephone minimally within a reasonably small area of it. The location information provided for telephones behind a telephone system is called Phone Switch-ALI (PS-ALI). 

To implement this, the telephone system must first be able to provide the F&amp;ES answering station with the telephone number from which the emergency call originated via ANI. If the answering point is outside the telephone system, the number provided must be the exact Direct Inward Dialing (DID) number of the telephone placing the call so the answering point can dial it directly. The number provided must not be that of an outbound trunk. This phone number must be correlated to its physical address or location within the facility via PS-ALI. 

To implement PS-ALI, the owner/operator of a telephone system is responsible for maintaining an up-to-date database containing the telephone number (DID number and/or extension number) and physical location of each telephone attached to the telephone system. This database is then used to provide the PS-ALI information to the ALI database(s) accessed by the F&amp;ES answering point. In association with each telephone and telephone number in the telephone system, the PS-ALI information contained in the database includes the following: 
- The address of the site containing the telephone system unless provided to the answering point by the LEC as part of its ANI/ALI information.
- The name (or number) of the building in which the telephone is located.
- The address of the building in which the telephone is located.
- The floor in the building on which the telephone is located.
- The area or quadrant of the floor where the telephone is located.
- The room or cubicle number where the telephone is located.

Additional information should be provided to the F&amp;ES answering point and emergency services personnel in the form of up-to-date facility maps and floor plans. The maintenance of facility maps, floor plans, and PS-ALI information to keep them up to date is critical to life safety and facility protection and security. This can be an onerous process in light of changes in the facility and moves, adds, and changes within the telephone system. Maintaining accurate location information is exacerbated in a VoIP telephone system due to the ability of an IP phone to change its physical location within the LAN (and possibly beyond) while keeping its telephone number without specific intervention from, or knowledge of, the telephone system operator. The PS_ALI database can quickly become inaccurate, which is a situation that could be life threatening. 

Automated systems can be used with a VoIP system and LAN to identify the general location of an IP phone within the facility based on the LAN switch and port to which the phone is connected. Once this information is obtained from the LAN, it is correlated with the documented location of the LAN switch and documented location of the outlet served by the switchport.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Enterprise Voice, Video, and Messaging Policy</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Enterprise Voice, Video, and Messaging Policy</dc:subject><dc:identifier>5585</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-001606</ident><fixtext fixref="F-63560r946686_fix">Configure the local DOD telephone system, VoIP or traditional, to provide the originating telephone number and the physical location of an F&amp;ES caller to the emergency services answering point through a transfer of ANI and PS-ALI information or the emergency services answering point is provided automated access to the required PS-ALI database.</fixtext><fix id="F-63560r946686_fix" /><check system="C-63653r946685_chk"><check-content-ref href="Enterprise_Voice,_Video,_and_Messaging_Policy_SRG.xml" name="M" /><check-content>Inspect the telephone system configuration or external database to determine compliance with the requirement.

NOTE: If the F&amp;ES calls are routed to a public entity outside the private telephone system, the call must route to an internal emergency number in parallel with the external call. Both calls should have the same priority. This is so the site can be aware of the emergency and assist the F&amp;ES responders in reaching the location of the caller.

If a public F&amp;ES answering point is the primary answering point for the site, calls must be directly routed to it and not relayed via a local emergency answering point. A second call from the local emergency answering point should not be required to obtain emergency services from the public F&amp;ES answering point unless the site maintains full and comparable police, fire, and medical services and its answering point is the primary.

Multiple MFSSs in the DISN NIPRNet IPVS network and multiple SSs in the DISN SIPRNet IPVS network have been implemented to provide networkwide redundancy of their functions.

They broker the establishment of calls between enclaves. An MFSS provides the following functions: 
- Receives AS-SIP-TLS messages from other MFSSs and a specific set of regionally associated LSCs to act as a call routing manager across the backbone. 
- Sends AS-SIP-TLS messages to interrogate the ability of another MFSS or an LSC to receive a call, whether routine or priority. 
- Sends AS-SIP-TLS messages to manage the establishment of priority calls and the preemption of lower priority calls to LSCs and other MFSSs.
- Once a "trunk side" session request is received, the MFSS determines if the destination is one of its assigned LSCs. If so, it interrogates that LSC to determine if it can receive the call. If so, it signals to establish the call. If the destination is not one of its LSCs, it signals with other MFSSs to locate the destination LSC and then the remote MFSS negotiates with its LSC. 
- Acts as a backup MFSS for LSCs assigned to other MFSSs as primary. An LSC must be able to signal with an MFSS to establish any call across the DISN WAN. LSCs do not interact directly with LSCs. This hierarchical arrangement is required in order to manage and establish priority calls and manage access circuit budgets. Each LSC must have a backup MFSS. In support of this function, MFSSs must be operated in pairs with all the information about its assigned LSCs replicated across the pair.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Enterprise Voice, Video, and Messaging Policy</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Enterprise Voice, Video, and Messaging Policy</dc:subject><dc:identifier>5585</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-001548</ident><fixtext fixref="F-63576r946734_fix">Ensure each MFSS is configured to synchronize with a paired MFSS so that each may serve as a backup for the other when signaling with its assigned LSCs and regarding the overall operation of the DISN IPVS network and the negotiation of call establishment between enclaves.</fixtext><fix id="F-63576r946734_fix" /><check system="C-63669r946733_chk"><check-content-ref href="Enterprise_Voice,_Video,_and_Messaging_Policy_SRG.xml" name="M" /><check-content>Inspect the configuration of the MFSS to determine compliance with the requirement.

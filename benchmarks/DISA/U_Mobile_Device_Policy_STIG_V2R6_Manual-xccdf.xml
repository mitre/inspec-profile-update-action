This requirement applies to mobile operating system (OS) mobile devices.

This requirement also applies to sensitive DoD information stored on mobile OS devices that are not authorized to connect to DoD networks or store/process sensitive DoD information. Sensitive DoD data or information is defined as any data/information that has not been approved for public release by the site/Command Public Affairs Officer (PAO).

In accordance with DoD policy, all components must establish Incident Handling and Response procedures. A CMI or “data spill” occurs when a classified email is inadvertently sent on an unclassified network and received on a wireless email device. Classified information may also be transmitted through some other form of file transfer to include web browser downloads and files transferred through tethered connections.  Mobile devices are not authorized for processing classified data. 

A data spill also occurs if a classified document is attached to an otherwise unclassified email. A data spill will only occur if the classified attached document is viewed or opened by the  mobile device user since the  mobile device system only downloads an attachment on the  mobile device if the user views or opens the attachment. The site's Incident Handling and Response procedures should reference NSA/CSS Storage Device Declassification Manual 9-12, Section 5, for smartphone destruction procedures. 

Check Procedures: 
Interview the ISSO. Verify classified incident handling, response, and reporting procedures are documented in site  mobile device procedures or security policies. If classified incident handling, response, and reporting procedures are not documented in site  mobile device procedures or security policies, this is a finding.

This requirement applies at both sites where  mobile devices are issued and managed and at sites where the  mobile device management server is located.

- At the  mobile device management server site, verify Incident Handling and Response procedures include actions to sanitize the  mobile device management server and email servers (e.g., Exchange, Oracle mail). 

- At  mobile device sites, verify Incident Handling and Response procedures include actions for incident reporting and actions to safeguard classified smartphone devices. The following actions will be followed for all  mobile devices involved in a data spill:

If Incident Handling and Response procedures do not include required information, this is a finding.

Check Procedures: 
Interview the ISSO. Determine if the site has had a data spill within the previous 24 months. If yes, review written records, incident reports, and/or after action reports and determine if required procedures were followed. 

If the site had a data spill within the previous 24 months and required procedures were not followed, this is a finding.

This requirement applies to mobile operating system (OS) CMDs.

All mobile device users must receive required training on the following topics before they are provided a mobile device or allowed access to DoD networks with a mobile device. 

a. Requirement that personally-owned mobile devices are not used to transmit, receive, store, or process DoD information unless approved by the AO and the owner signs forfeiture agreement in case of a security incident.

b. Procedures for mobile device usage in and around classified processing areas.

c. Requirement that mobile devices with digital cameras (still and video) are not allowed in any SCIF or other areas where classified documents or information is stored, transmitted, or processed.

d. Procedures for a data spill. 

e. Requirement that Over-The-Air (OTA) mobile device software updates should only come from DoD-approved sources. 

f. When Wi-Fi is used, the following training will be completed: 
- Procedures for setting up a secure Wi-Fi connection and verifying the active connection is to a known access point. 

- Approved connection options (i.e., enterprise, home, etc.). 

- Requirements for home Wi-Fi connections. 

- The mobile device Wi-Fi radio will be disabled by the user whenever a Wi-Fi connection is not being used.

g. Do not discuss FOUO or classified information on non-secure (devices whose cryptographic modules protecting data in transit are not FIPS 140-2 certified or NSA Type-1 certified for voice) cellular phones, cordless phones, and two-way radios used for voice communications. 

h. Do not connect mobile devices to any workstation. 

i. The installation of user owned applications, including geo-location aware applications, on the mobile device will be based on the Command’s Mobile Device Personal Use Policy and AO approval.

j. The use of the mobile OS device to view and/or download personal email will be based the Command’s Mobile Device Personal Use Policy and AO approval.

k. The download of user owned data (music files, picture files, etc.) on the mobile device will be based the Command’s Mobile Device Personal Use Policy and AO approval.

l. All radios on the mobile device (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, near-field communications (NFC)) must be turned off when not needed. This does not apply to radios supporting voice and data communication over a wireless carrier’s cellular network, in which case continuous connectivity is permissible.

m. Procedure on how to disable Location Services on the device. Location Services must be disabled for all applications or enabled only for applications approved by the AO for location based services.

Note: Listing training requirements in the User Agreement is an acceptable procedure for informing/training users on many of the required training topics. 

Check Procedures: 
- Review site mobile device training material to see if it contains the required content. 
Note: Some training content may be listed in the User Agreement signed by the user. 

- Verify site training records show that mobile device users received required training and training occurred before the user was issued a mobile device. Check training records for approximately five users, picked at random.

STANDARD MANDATORY NOTICE AND CONSENT PROVISION FOR ALL DOD INFORMATION SYSTEM USER AGREEMENTS

By signing this document, you acknowledge and consent that when you access
Department of Defense (DoD) information systems:
- You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) information system (IS) (which includes any device attached to this information system) that is provided for U.S. Government authorized use only.
- You consent to the following conditions:
o The U.S. Government routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this information system for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, communications security (COMSEC) monitoring, network operations and defense, personal misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.
o At any time, the U.S. Government may inspect and seize data stored on this information system.
o Communications using, or data stored on, this information system are not private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any U.S. Government-authorized purpose.
o This information system includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect U.S. Government interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy.
o Notwithstanding the above, using an information system does not constitute consent to personnel misconduct, law enforcement, or counterintelligence investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications or data (including work product) that are related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants. Under these circumstances, such communications and work product are private and confidential, as further explained below:
- Nothing in this User Agreement shall be interpreted to limit the user's consent to, or in any other way restrict or affect, any U.S. Government actions for purposes of network administration, operation, protection, or defense, or for communications security. This includes all communications and data on an information system, regardless of any applicable privilege or confidentiality.
- The user consents to interception/capture and seizure of ALL communications and data for any authorized purpose (including personal misconduct, law enforcement, or counterintelligence investigation). However, consent to interception/capture or seizure of communications and data is not consent to the use of privileged communications or data for personnel misconduct, law enforcement, or counterintelligence investigation against any party and does not negate any applicable privilege or confidentiality that otherwise applies.
- Whether any particular communication or data qualifies for the protection of a privilege, or is covered by a duty of confidentiality, is determined in accordance with established legal standards and DoD policy. Users are strongly encouraged to seek personal legal counsel on such matters prior to using an information system if the user intends to rely on the protections of a privilege or confidentiality.
- Users should take reasonable steps to identify such communications or data that the user asserts are protected by any such privilege or confidentiality. However, the user's identification or assertion of a privilege or confidentiality is not sufficient to create such protection where none exists under established legal standards and DoD policy.
- A user's failure to take reasonable steps to identify such communications or data as privileged or confidential does not waive the privilege or confidentiality if such protections otherwise exist under established legal standards and DoD policy. However, in such cases the U.S. Government is authorized to take reasonable actions to identify such communication or data as being subject to a privilege or confidentiality, and such actions do not negate any applicable privilege or confidentiality.
- These conditions preserve the confidentiality of the communication or data, and the legal protections regarding the use and disclosure of privileged information, and thus such communications and data are private and confidential. Further, the U.S. Government shall take all reasonable measures to protect the content of captured/seized privileged communications and data to ensure they are appropriately protected.
o In cases when the user has consented to content searching or monitoring of communications or data for personnel misconduct, law enforcement, or counterintelligence investigative searching, (i.e., for all communications and data other than privileged communications or data that are related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants), the U.S. Government may, solely at its discretion and in accordance with DoD policy, elect to apply a privilege or other restriction on the U.S. Government's otherwise-authorized use or disclosure of such information.
o All of the above conditions apply regardless of whether the access or use of an information system includes the display of a Notice and Consent Banner ("banner"). When a banner is used, the banner functions to remind the user of the conditions that are set forth in this User Agreement, regardless of whether the banner describes these conditions in full detail or provides a summary of such conditions, and regardless of whether the banner expressly references this User Agreement.

2. DoD sites are required to add the following to all site User Agreements:
- The agreement should contain the type of access required by the user (privileged, end-user, etc.).
- The agreement should contain the responsibilities, liabilities, and security measures (e.g., malicious code detection training) involved in the use of the wireless remote access device.
- Incident handling and reporting procedures will be identified along with a designated point of contact.
- The remote user can be held responsible for damage caused to a Government system or data through negligence or a willful act.
- The policy should contain general security requirements and practices, which are acknowledged and signed by the remote user.
- If classified devices are used for remote access from an alternative work site, the remote user will adhere to DoD policy in regard to facility clearances, protection, storage, distributing, etc.
- Government owned hardware and software is used for official duties only. The employee is the only individual authorized to use this equipment.
- User agrees to complete required wireless device training annually.

Check Procedures:

1. Inspect a copy of the site’s user agreement.
2. Verify the user agreement has the minimum elements described in the STIG policy. 
3. Select 10 names of assigned site personnel and verify they have a signed user agreement on file for assigned wireless equipment (e.g., wireless laptop, smartphone, tablet, etc.).

If site user agreements do not exist or are not compliant with the minimum requirements, this is a finding.

Note: This requirement does not apply to NSA-approved classified WLAN systems or SCIFs

The ISSO will ensure wireless devices are not operated in areas where classified information is electronically stored, processed, or transmitted unless:
- Approved by the Authorizing Official (AO) in consultation with the Certified TEMPEST Technical Authority (CTTA).
- The wireless equipment is separated from the classified data equipment at the minimum distance determined by the CTTA and appropriate countermeasures, as determined by the CTTA, are implemented.

Check Procedures:

Review documentation. Work with the traditional security reviewer to verify the following:
1. If classified information is not processed at this site, mark as not a finding.
2. If the site has a written procedure prohibiting the use of wireless devices in areas where classified data processing occurs, mark as not a finding. Ask for documentation showing the CTTA was consulted about operation and placement of wireless devices. Acceptable proof would be the signature or initials of the CTTA on the architecture diagram or other evidence of coordination. IAW DoD policy, the CTTA must have a written separation policy for each classified area. 
3. Review written policies, training material, or user agreements to see if wireless usage in these areas is addressed. 
4. Verify proper procedures for wireless device use in classified areas is addressed in training program.

If wireless devices are used in or around classified processing areas but the CTTA has not designated a separation distance in writing, the AO has not coordinated with the CTTA, or 
users are not trained or made aware (using signage or user agreement) of procedures for wireless device usage in and around classified processing areas, this is a finding.

The site must have an Interim Authority To Test (IATT) issued by the Component CIO.

For all other wireless devices and systems the Designated Approval Authority (DAA) must approve the wireless device or system. 

Detailed Check Procedures:
Work with the site POC to verify documentation. Performed with WIR0016 (equipment list).

For CMD systems without a STIG, verify the site has an approved IATT. Mark as a finding if a valid IATT is not available or is not signed by the Component CIO.

For all other wireless devices or systems, complete the following:
1. Request copies of written DAA approval documentation. Any of the following documents meets this requirement as proof of compliance:
- The DIACAP IA Implementation Plan must show the wireless system as part of the network diagram or list the system/equipment as being part of the network.
- DAA approval letter or other document. The document must list the system or equipment and date its use is approved.
The DAA approval letter or SSP may be a general statement of approval rather than list each device. 

2. Verify DAA approval for type of device used, such as wireless connection services, peripherals, and applications. 

Mark as a finding for any of the following reasons:
- Wireless systems, devices, services, or accessories are in use but DAA approval letter(s) do not exist.
- If, in the judgment of the reviewer, configuration differs significantly from that approved by the DAA approval letter.

Note: The DAA approval for the wireless system does not need to be documented separately from other DAA approval documents for the site network, as long as the approval documents list the wireless system. For example, if a site network ATO lists the wireless system, the ATO meets the requirements of this check.

For Secure Mobile Environment Portable Electronic Device (SME PED), the following applies:
- An ATO or an IATO has been signed by the DAA prior to the connection of the unclassified Sensa server to the NIPRNet.
- Classified Connection Approval Office (CCAO) approval has been obtained prior to the connection of the classified Sensa server to the SIPRNet.

Note: The intent of this check is to ensure the DAA has approved the use of the wireless system being reviewed at the site. This approval can be documented in several ways. The most common is the SSP for the site includes the wireless system and the DAA has signed the SSP. If the command uses an enterprise wide SSP including the wireless system being reviewed and the SSP applies to site being reviewed, then the requirement has been met.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-8284"><title>Site list of approved CMDs</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-8779r6_rule" severity="low" weight="10.0"><version>WIR0015</version><title>The site IAO must maintain a list of all DAA-approved wireless and non-wireless PED devices that store, process, or transmit DoD information. </title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;The site must maintain a list of all DAA-approved wireless and non-wireless CMDs.

This check applies to any wireless end user device (smartphone, tablet, Wi-Fi network interface card, etc.) and wireless network devices (access point, authentication server, etc.). The list of approved wireless devices will be stored in a secure location and will include the following at a minimum:
- Access point Media Access Control (MAC) address (WLAN only),
- Access point IP address (WLAN only),
- Wireless client MAC address,
- Network DHCP range (WLAN &amp; WWAN only),
- Type of encryption enabled,
- Access point SSID (WLAN only),
- Manufacturer, model number, and serial number of wireless equipment,
- Equipment location, and
- Assigned users with telephone numbers.

For  CMDs:
- Manufacturer, model number, and serial number of wireless equipment.
- Equipment location or who the device was issued to.
- Assigned users with telephone numbers and email addresses.

For SME PED:
Local commands will keep track of devices by assigning a control number or using the serial number for accountability purposes.

Check Procedures:

Work with the site POC: 
1. Request copies of site’s wireless equipment list. 
-Detailed SSAA/SSP or database may be used. 
2. Verify all minimum data elements listed above are included in the equipment list. 
3. Verify all wireless devices used at the site, including infrared mice/keyboards, are included. 
4. Verify procedures are in place for ensuring the list is kept updated. 
5. Note the date of last update and if the list has many inaccuracies. 
Mark as a finding if the equipment list does not exist, all data elements are not tracked, or the list is outdated.

This check applies to: 
- Wireless networking devices, such as access points, bridges, and switches.
- WLAN client devices, such as laptop computers and PDAs if used with WLAN NICs.
- Wireless peripherals, such as Bluetooth, and Infrared mice and keyboards, communications devices, such as VoIP, cellular/satellite telephones, and Broadband NICs, and non-wireless CMDs that store, process, or transmit DoD information.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-8297"><title>Site security plan includes wireless system/equipment</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-8792r5_rule" severity="low" weight="10.0"><version>WIR0020</version><title>Wireless devices connecting directly or indirectly to the network must be included in the site security plan.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;The DAA and site commander must be aware of all approved wireless devices used at the site or DoD data could be exposed to unauthorized people.

This includes all communications and data on an information system, regardless of any applicable privilege or confidentiality.
- The user consents to interception/capture and seizure of ALL communications and data for any authorized purpose (including personal misconduct, law enforcement, or counterintelligence investigation). However, consent to interception/capture or seizure of communications and data is not consent to the use of privileged communications or data for personnel misconduct, law enforcement, or counterintelligence investigation against any party and does not negate any applicable privilege or confidentiality that otherwise applies.
- Whether any particular communication or data qualifies for the protection of a privilege, or is covered by a duty of confidentiality, is determined in accordance with established legal standards and DoD policy. Users are strongly encouraged to seek personal legal counsel on such matters prior to using an information system if the user intends to rely on the protections of a privilege or confidentiality.
- Users should take reasonable steps to identify such communications or data that the user asserts are protected by any such privilege or confidentiality. However, the user's identification or assertion of a privilege or confidentiality is not sufficient to create such protection where none exists under established legal standards and DoD policy.
- A user's failure to take reasonable steps to identify such communications or data as privileged or confidential does not waive the privilege or confidentiality if such protections otherwise exist under established legal standards and DoD policy. However, in such cases the U.S. Government is authorized to take reasonable actions to identify such communication or data as being subject to a privilege or confidentiality, and such actions do not negate any applicable privilege or confidentiality.
- These conditions preserve the confidentiality of the communication or data, and the legal protections regarding the use and disclosure of privileged information, and thus such communications and data are private and confidential. Further, the U.S. Government shall take all reasonable measures to protect the content of captured/seized privileged communications and data to ensure they are appropriately protected.
o In cases when the user has consented to content searching or monitoring of communications or data for personnel misconduct, law enforcement, or counterintelligence investigative searching, (i.e., for all communications and data other than privileged communications or data that are related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants), the U.S. Government may, solely at its discretion and in accordance with DoD policy, elect to apply a privilege or other restriction on the U.S. Government's otherwise-authorized use or disclosure of such information.
o All of the above conditions apply regardless of whether the access or use of an information system includes the display of a Notice and Consent Banner ("banner"). When a banner is used, the banner functions to remind the user of the conditions that are set forth in this User Agreement, regardless of whether the banner describes these conditions in full detail or provides a summary of such conditions, and regardless of whether the banner expressly references this User Agreement.

2. For SME PED, see the SME PED User Agreement template included with the SME PED STIG for specific requirements.

3. DoD sites are required to add the following to all site User Agreements:
- The agreement should contain the type of access required by the user (privileged, end-user, etc.).
- The agreement should contain the responsibilities, liabilities, and security measures (e.g., malicious code detection training) involved in the use of the wireless remote access device.
- Incident handling and reporting procedures will be identified along with a designated point of contact.
- The remote user can be held responsible for damage caused to a Government system or data through negligence or a willful act.
- The policy should contain general security requirements and practices, which are acknowledged and signed by the remote user.
- If classified devices are used for remote access from an alternative work site, the remote user will adhere to DoD policy in regard to facility clearances, protection, storage, distributing, etc.
- Government owned hardware and software is used for official duties only. The employee is the only individual authorized to use this equipment.
- User agrees to complete required wireless device training annually.

4. For approved smartphone and tablet devices add to all User Agreements:
- Only approved Bluetooth headsets/handsfree devices will be used.

Check Procedures:

1. Inspect a copy of the site’s user agreement.
2. Verify the user agreement has the minimum elements described in the STIG policy. 
3. Select 10 names of assigned site personnel and verify they have a signed user agreement on file for assigned wireless equipment (e.g., wireless laptop, smartphone, tablet, etc.).

Mark as a finding if site user agreements do not exist or are not compliant with the minimum requirements.

For SME PED:
- Verify the Terminal Administrator (TA) has users reaffirm their User Agreement at least once every 12 months. Review the dates that site User Agreements were signed.

This requirement applies to mobile operating system (OS) CMDs.

This requirement also applies to sensitive DoD information stored on mobile OS devices that are not authorized to connect to DoD networks or store/process sensitive DoD information. Sensitive DoD data or information is defined as any data/information that has not been approved for public release by the site/Command Public Affairs Officer (PAO).

In accordance with DoD policy, all components must establish Incident Handling and Response procedures. A CMI or “data spill” occurs when a classified email is inadvertently sent on an unclassified network and received on a wireless email device. Classified information may also be transmitted through some other form of file transfer to include web browser downloads and files transferred through tethered connections. CMDs are not authorized for processing classified data. 

A data spill also occurs if a classified document is attached to an otherwise unclassified email. For BlackBerry and Good Mobile Messaging systems, a data spill will only occur if the classified attached document is viewed or opened by the CMD user since the CMD system only downloads an attachment on the CMD if the user views or opens the attachment. The site's Incident Handling and Response procedures should reference NSA/CSS Storage Device Declassification Manual 9-12, Section 5, for smartphone destruction procedures. 

Check Procedures: 
Interview the IAO. Verify classified incident handling, response, and reporting procedures are documented in site CMD procedures or security policies. Mark as a finding if classified incident handling, response, and reporting procedures are not documented in site CMD procedures or security policies.

This requirement applies at both sites where CMDs are issued and managed and at sites where the CMD management server is located.

---At the CMD management server site, verify Incident Handling and Response procedures include actions to sanitize the CMD management server and email servers (e.g., Exchange, Oracle mail). 

---At CMD sites, verify Incident Handling and Response procedures include actions for incident reporting and actions to safeguard classified smartphone devices. The following actions will be followed for all CMDs involved in a data spill:

-BlackBerry CMDs: follow procedures in the DoD Data Spill Procedures Guide for BlackBerry Smartphones located at http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/net_perimeter/wireless/smartphone.html. 

-Windows Mobile, Android, and iOS CMDs: the CMD will be destroyed.
